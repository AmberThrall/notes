Recall that a topological space is [[A. Point-Set Topology|second countable]] if it has a countable basis.

# Topological Manifolds


> [!def] 
> A topological space $M$ is **locally Euclidean of dimension n** if every point $p\in M$ has a neighborhood $U$ such that there is a homeomorphism $\phi:U\rightarrow V\subset\R^n$. We call the pair $(U,\phi)$ a **chart**, $U$ a **coordinate neighborhood** or **coordinate open set** and $\phi$ a **coordinate map** or **coordinate system** on $U$.

> [!def]
> A **topological manifold** is a Hausdorff, second countable, locally Euclidean space.

**Example:** The Euclidean space $\R^n$ is covered by a single chart $(\R^n,1_{\R^n})$. Hence $\R^n$ is an $n$-dimensional topological manifold.

**Example:** The graph of $y=x^{2/3}$ in $\R^2$ is a topological manifold. Since it is a subspace of $\R^2$, it is Hausdorff and second countable. The homeomorphism $(x,x^{2/3})\mapsto x$ shows that it is locally Euclidean.

**Example:** The two axes in $\R^2$ with the subspace topology is not a topological manifold due the intersection at the origin. Indeed, assume the axes were locally Euclidean at the origin. Then their is a neighborhood $U$ of the origin homeomorphic to an open ball $B(0,\epsilon)\subset\R^2$. Notice that $U\setminus\{0\}$ has four connected components, whereas $B(0,\epsilon)\setminus\{0\}$ has one. Therefore, they are not homeomorphic.

In order for the definition of manifold to be well defined, we need to ensure that every neighborhood is homeomorphic to a open set in $\R^n$ for the same degree $n$. This is known as the *invariance of dimension* and is true.

# Compatible Charts

Let $(U,\phi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ be charts. Since $U$ and $V$ are open, it follows that $U\cap V$ is open. Moreover, since $\phi$ and $\psi$ are homeomorphisms, it follows that $\phi(U\cap V)$ and $\psi(U\cap V)$ are open.

> [!def]
> Two charts $(U,\phi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ are **$C^\infty$-compatible** if the two **transition maps**
> $$
> 	\phi\circ\psi^{-1}:\psi(U\cap V)\rightarrow\phi(U\cap V),~\psi\circ\phi^{-1}:\phi(U\cap V)\rightarrow\psi(U\cap V)
> $$
> are $C^\infty$. If the two charts do not intersect, they are automatically $C^\infty$-compatible.

Some authors use $U_{\alpha\beta}$ for $U_\alpha\cap U_\beta$.

> [!def]
> A $C^\infty$ **atlas** on a locally Euclidean space $M$ is a collection $\mathfrak{U}=\{(U_\alpha,\phi_\alpha)\}$ of pairwise $C^\infty$-compatible charts that cover $M$, i.e., $M=\bigcup_{\alpha}U_\alpha$.

**Example:** The unit circle can be viewed as the complex subset 
$$
	S^1 = \{e^{it}\in\bb{C}\mid0\le t\le 2\pi\}.
$$
Define the two open subsets
$$
\begin{align*}
	U_1 &= \{e^{it}\in\bb{C}\mid-\pi<t<\pi\} \\
	U_2 &= \{e^{it}\in\bb{C}\mid0<t<2\pi\}.
\end{align*}
$$
Define the coordinate maps
$$
\begin{align*}
	\phi_1(e^{it}) &= t, &-\pi<t<\pi \\
	\phi_2(e^{it}) &= t, &0<t<2\pi	
\end{align*}
$$
One may show that $(U_1,\phi_1)$ and $(U_2,\phi_2)$ are charts on $S^1$. The intersection $U_1\cap U_2$ consists of two connected components:
$$
\begin{align*}
	A &= \{e^{it}\in\bb{C}\mid-\pi<t<0\} \\
	B &= \{e^{it}\in\bb{C}\mid0<t<\pi\}
\end{align*}
$$
and
$$
\begin{align*}
	\phi_1(U_1\cap U_2) &= \phi_1(A\cup B) = (-\pi,0)\cup(0,\pi) \\
	\phi_2(U_1\cap U_2) &= \phi_2(A\cup B) = (\pi,2\pi)\cup(0,\pi)
\end{align*}
$$

The transition maps are given by
$$
	(\phi_2\circ\phi_1^{-1})(t) = \begin{cases}
		t+2\pi & \text{if }t\in(-\pi,0) \\
		t & \text{if }t\in(0,\pi)
	\end{cases}
$$
and
$$
	(\phi_1\circ\phi_2^{-1})(t) = \begin{cases}
		t-2\pi & \text{if }t\in(\pi,2\pi) \\
		t & \text{if }t\in(0,\pi).
	\end{cases}
$$
Therefore, $(U_1,\phi_1)$ and $(U_2,\phi_2)$ form a $C^\infty$ atlas on $S^1$.


$C^\infty$-compatible is not an equivalence relation. While it is reflexive and symmetric, it is not necessarily transitive.

We say a chart $(V,\psi)$ is **compatible with an atlas** $\{(U_\alpha,\phi_\alpha)\}$ if it is compatible with all the charts $(U_\alpha,\phi_\alpha)$ of the atlas.

> [!lemma]
> Let $\{(U_\alpha,\phi_\alpha)\}$ be an atlas on a locally Euclidean space. If two charts $(V,\psi)$ and $(W,\sigma)$ are both compatible with the atlas, then they are compatible with each other.

**Proof:**  Let $p\in V\cap W$. Note there is some $\alpha$ such that $p\in U_\alpha$. Thus, $p\in V\cap W\cap U_\alpha$. So
$$
	\sigma\circ\psi^{-1}=(\sigma\circ\phi_\alpha^{-1})\circ(\phi_\alpha\circ\psi^{-1})
$$
is $C^\infty$ on $V\cap W\cap U_\alpha$. This holds for all $p\in V\cap W$. Therefore, $\sigma\circ\psi^{-1}$ is $C^\infty$ on $V\cap W$. A similar argument holds for $\psi\circ\sigma^{-1}$.

# Smooth Manifolds

An atlas is considered **maximal** if it is not contained in a larger atlas.

> [!def] 
> A **smooth** or $C^\infty$**-manifold** is a topological manifold $M$ together with a maximal atlas. The maximal atlas is called a **differentiable structure** on $M$.

In practice, one only needs to find any atlas to show a topological manifold is a smooth manifold.

> [!prp]
> Any atlas $\mathfrak{U}=\{(U_\alpha,\phi_\alpha)\}$ on a locally Euclidean space is contained in a unique maximal atlas.

**Proof:** Adjoin all charts $(V_i,\psi_i)$ that are compatible with $\mathfrak{U}$. The resulting atlas is maximal and unique.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>


To show a topological space $M$ is a smooth manifold it suffices to check that
1. $M$ is Hausdorff and second countable
2. $M$ has a $C^\infty$ atlas.

Let $r^1,\dots,r^n$ be the standard coordinates on $\R^n$. For a chart $(U,\phi)$ we let $x^i=r^i\circ\phi$ be the $i$-th component of $\phi$ and write $(U,\phi)=(U,x^1,\dots,x^n)$. We call the functions $x^1,\dots,x^n$ **coordinates** or **local coordinates** on $U$.
# Examples of Smooth Manifolds

**Example:** The Euclidean space $\R^n$ is a smooth manifold with the chart $(\R^n,r^1,\dots,r^n)$ where $r^1,\dots,r^n$ are the standard coordinates on $\R^n$.

**Example:** Any open subset $V$ of a manifold $M$ is also a manifold under the subspace topology. Let $\{(U_\alpha,\phi_\alpha)\}$ be an atlas for $M$, and notice that $\{(U_\alpha\cap V,\phi_\alpha|_{U_\alpha\cap V})\}$ forms an atlas for $V$.

**Example:** In a manifold of dimension zero, every singleton subset is homeomorphic to $\R^0$ and hence open. So every zero-degree manifold is a discrete set.

**Example:** For a subset $A\subset\R^n$ and function $f:A\rightarrow\R^m$, we define the **graph** of $f$ to be the subset
$$
	\Gamma(f) = \{(x,f(x))\in A\times\R^m\}.
$$
Consider an open subset $U\subset\R^n$ and assume that $f$ is $C^\infty$ on $U$. Then the map
$$
	\phi:\Gamma(f)\rightarrow U,~(x,f(x))\mapsto x
$$
and the map
$$
	(1,f):U\rightarrow\Gamma(f), ~ x\mapsto(x,f(x))
$$
are continuous and inverses of each other. Hence, they are homeomorphisms. Therefore, the graph of a $C^\infty$ function $f:U\rightarrow\R^m$ is a $C^\infty$ manifold with the atlas comprised of a single chart, $(\Gamma(f),\phi)$.

**Example:** Notice that $\R^{m\times n}$ is isomorphic to $\R^{mn}$. Hence we can give the topology of $\R^{mn}$ to $\R^{m\times n}$. The **general linear group** is the set of invertible matrices:
$$
	\textup{GL}(n,\R) := \{A\in\R^{n\times n}\mid\det A\ne 0\} = \text{det}^{-1}(\R^\setminus\{0\}).
$$
Since $\det:\R^{n\times n}\rightarrow\R$ is continuous, the general linear group is an open subset of $\R^{n\times n}$. Therefore, it is a manifold of dimension $n^2$ by our second example.

By similar reasoning, the **complex general linear group** $\textup{GL}(n,\bb{C})$ is also a manifold of dimension $2n^2$.

> [!prp]
> If $\{(U_\alpha,\phi_\alpha)\}$ and $\{(V_\beta,\psi_\beta)\}$ are $C^\infty$ atlases for manifolds $M$ and $N$ of dimensions $m$ and $n$, respectively, then the collection
> $$
> 	\{(U_\alpha\times V_\beta,\phi_\alpha\times\psi_\beta)\}
> $$
> of charts is a $C^\infty$ atlas on $M\times N$. Therefore, $M\times N$ is a manifold of dimension $m+n$.

**Proof:** Recall that the product of Hausdorff spaces are Hausdorff. Moreover, the product of second countable spaces are second countable. Hence we simply show that the above collection forms a $C^\infty$ atlas.

Let $(U_{\alpha_1}\times V_{\beta_1},\phi_{\alpha_1}\times\psi_{\beta_1})$ and $(U_{\alpha_2}\times V_{\beta_2},\phi_{\alpha_2}\times\psi_{\beta_2})$  be overlapping charts. Notice that 
$$
\begin{align*}
((\phi_{\alpha_1}\times\psi_{\beta_1})\circ(\phi_{\alpha_2}\times\psi_{\beta_2})^{-1})(x,y) &= (\phi_{\alpha_1}\times\psi_{\beta_1})(\phi_{\alpha_2}^{-1}(x),\psi_{\beta_2}^{-1}(y)) \\
&= ((\phi_{\alpha_1}\circ\phi_{\alpha_2}^{-1})(x)),(\psi_{\beta_1}\circ\psi_{\beta_2}^{-1})(y)).
\end{align*}
$$
Since $\{(U_\alpha,\phi_\alpha)\}$ is an atlas for $M$, $\phi_{\alpha_1}\circ\phi_{\alpha_2}^{-1}$ is $C^\infty$. Likewise, $\psi_{\beta_1}\circ\psi_{\beta_2}^{-1}$ is $C^\infty$. Therefore, the product of the two is $C^\infty$. An identical argument holds for the opposite transition map.

Therefore, $M\times N$ is a manifold of dimension $m+n$.

**Example:** As a consequence of the previous proposition, the infinite cylinder $S^1\times\R$ and the torus $S^1\times S^1$ are smooth manifolds. Moreover, the $n$-dimensional torus $S^1\times\cdots\times S^1$ is also a manifold.

For dimensions less than 4, every topological manifold has a unique differentiable structure. In dimensions greater than 4, every compact topological manifold has a finite number of differentiable structures. Nothing is known about dimension 4.

> [!conjecture] Smooth Poincare conjecture
> $S^4$ has a unique differentiable structure.

As shown by Michel Kervaire, there exists topological manifolds with no differentiable structure, i.e., there are topological manifolds that are not $C^\infty$.
