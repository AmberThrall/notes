> [!def] Topology
> A **topology** on a set $S$ is a collection $\cal{T}$ of subsets such that
> 1. $\emptyset,S\in \cal{T}$
> 2. (Arbitrary union) if $U_a\in\cal{T}$ for all $a\in A$, then $\bigcup_{a\in A}U_a\in\cal{T}$

We call elements of a topology **open sets** and the pair $(S,\cal{T})$ a **topological space**. A **neighborhood** of a point $p\in S$ is an open set $U$ that contains $p$.

**Example:** The standard topology for $\R^n$ consists of sets $U$ that are open if and only if for every $p\in U$, there is a open ball $B(p,\epsilon)$ with center $p$ and radius $\epsilon$ contained in $U$.

If $\cal{T}_1$ and $\cal{T}_2$ are both topologies of $S$ and $\cal{T}_1\subset\cal{T}_2$, then we say that $\cal{T}_2$ is **finer** than $\cal{T}_1$. Or equivalently, $\cal{T}_1$ is **coarser** than $\cal{T}_2$.

> [!lemma] Local criterion for openness
> Let $S$ be a topological space. A subset $A$ is open in $S$ if and only if for every $p\in A$, there is an open set $V$ such that $p\in V\subseteq A$.

**Proof:**
($\Rightarrow$): Clearly $p\in A\subseteq A$ for all $p\in A$.
($\Leftarrow$): Notice that for each $p\in A$ there is a open set $V_p\subset A$. But,
$$
	A = \bigcup_{p\in A}V_p
$$
and the arbitrary union of open sets is open.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

A set $V$ is called **closed** if it's complement $S\backslash V$ is open. By the use of de Morgan's laws, one can redefine a topology in terms of closed sets.

> [!def] Topology
> A **topology** on a set $S$ is a collection $\cal{T}$ of subsets such that
> 1. $\emptyset$ and $S$ are closed
> 2. (Arbitrary intersection) if $U_a$ is closed for all $a\in A$, then $\bigcap_{a\in A}U_a$ is closed.
> 3. (Finite union) if $U_1,\dots,U_n$ are closed, then $U_1\cup\cdots\cup U_n$ is closed.

# Subspace Topology

Let $(S,\cal{T})$ be a topological space and $A\subseteq S$. Define $\cal{T}_A$ to be the collection of subsets
$$
	\cal{T}_A = \{U\cap A\mid U\in\cal{T}\}.
$$
By the distributive property of union and intersection, one may show that $\cal{T}_A$ is closed under arbitrary union and finite intersection. Moreover, $\emptyset,A\in\cal{T}_A$. Thus, $\cal{T}_A$ is a topology on $A$ called the **subspace topology**.

**Example:** Consider the subset $A=[0,1]$ of $\R$. In the subspace topology, the half-open interval $[0,1/2)$ is open relative to $A$ since
$$
	[0,1/2) = (-1/2,1/2)\cap A
$$
and $(-1/2,1/2)$ is open in $\R$.

# Bases

Instead of explicitly stating all the possible open sets, we often make use of the local criterion for openness and define a basis of sets.

> [!def] Basis
> A subcollection $\cal{B}$ of a topology $\cal{T}$ on a topological space $S$ is a **basis** for $\cal{T}$ if given an open set $U$ and a point $p\in U$, there is an open set $B\in\cal{B}$ such that $p\in B\subset U$. We say that $\cal{B}$ **generates** the topology $\cal{T}$.

**Example:** The standard topology for $\R^n$ is generated by the collection of open balls
$$
	B(p,r) = \{x\in\R^n\mid d(p,x)<r\}
$$
for all $p\in\R^n$ and $r\in\R$.

> [!prp]
> A collection $\cal{B}$ of open sets of $S$ is a basis if and only if every open set in $S$ is a union of sets in $\cal{B}$.

**Proof:**
($\Rightarrow$): Let $U$ be open. Since $\cal{B}$ is a basis, there are open sets $V_p\in\cal{B}$ for each $p\in U$. Notice that
$$
	U = \bigcup_{p\in U}V_p.
$$
$(\Leftarrow$): Let $U$ be open and $p\in U$. Since $U=\bigcup_{a\in A}V_a$ with each $V_a\in\cal{B}$, there is some $a\in A$ such that $p\in V_a$. Thus, $\cal{B}$ is a basis.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

> [!prp]
> A collection $\cal{B}$ of subsets of a set $S$ is a basis for some topology $\cal{T}$ on $S$ if and only if
> 1. $S$ is the union of all sets in $\cal{B}$; and
> 2. given any two sets $B_1,B_2\in\cal{B}$ and a point $p\in B_1\cap B_2$, there is a set $B\in\cal{B}$ such that $p\in B\subset B_1\cap B_2$.

![[Screenshot from 2024-08-06 14-11-57.png#invert | center]]

**Proof:**
($\Rightarrow$): 
1. See previous proposition.
2. Since $\cal{B}$ is a basis, $B_1,B_2$ and $B_1\cap B_2$ are open. Hence, by the definition of basis, there is a $B\in\cal{B}$ such that $p\in B\subset B_1\cap B_2$.

($\Leftarrow$): Let $\cal{T}$ be the collection of all sets that unions of set sin $\cal{B}$. Note that $\emptyset, S\in\cal{T}$. Clearly, an arbitrary union of sets in $\cal{T}$ is in $\cal{T}$. For finite intersection, let $U=\bigcup_\mu B_\mu$ and $V=\bigcup_\nu B_\nu$ be sets in $\cal{T}$. Notice that
$$
	U\cap V = \left(\bigcup_\mu B_\mu\right)\cap\left(\bigcup_\nu B_\nu\right) = \bigcup_{\mu,\nu}(B_\mu\cap B_\nu).
$$
Hence, for any $p\in U\cap V$, it follows that $p\in B_\mu\cap B_\nu$ for some $\mu,\nu$. By property (2), there is a set $B_p\in\cal{B}$ such that $p\in B_p\subset B_\mu\cap B_\nu$. Therefore,
$$
	U\cap V = \bigcup_{p\in U\cap V}B_p.
$$
Hence, $\cal{T}$ is a topology.

> [!prp]
> Let $\cal{B}=\{B_\alpha\}$ be a basis for a topological space $S$, and $A$ a subspace of $S$. Then $\{B_\alpha\cap A\}$ is a basis for $A$.

**Proof:** Let $U$ be open relative to $A$, i.e., $U=U'\cap A$ for some open set $U'$ in $S$. Since $\cal{B}$ is a basis for $S$, it follows that $U'=\bigcup_\mu B_\mu$. Notice that
$$
	U = \left(\bigcup_\mu B_\mu\right)\cap A = \bigcup_\mu(B_\mu\cap A).
$$

# First and Second Countability

> [!def] Second countable
> A topological space is **second countable** if it has a countable basis.

**Example:** $\R^n$ is second countable since it is generated by the collection of open balls in $\R^n$ with rational centers and rational radii.

> [!prp]
> A subspace $A$ of a second-countable space $S$ is second countable.

**Proof:** Follows from proposition 7.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

> [!def] First Countable
> Let $S$ be a topological space and $p\in S$. A **basis of neighborhoods** at $p$ is a collection $\cal{B}=\{B_\alpha\}$ of neighborhoods of $p$ such that any neighborhood $U$ of $p$, there is a $B_\alpha\in\cal{B}$ such that $p\in B_\alpha\subseteq U$. A topological space $S$ is **first countable** if it has a countable basis of neighborhoods at every point $p\in S$.

**Example:** For any $p\in\R^n$, the collection $\{B(p,1/n)\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is a countable neighborhood basis at $p$. Thus, $\R^n$ is first countable.

**Example:** An uncountable discrete space is first countable but not second countable.

# Separation Axioms

> [!def] Hausdorff
> A topological space $S$ is **Hausdorff** if given any two distinct points $x,y\in S$, there exists disjoint open sets $U,V$ such that $x\in U$ and $y\in V$. A Hausdorff space is **normal** if given any two distinct closed sets $F,G$ in $S$, there exists disjoint open sets $U,V$ such that $F\subset U$ and $G\subset V$.

![[Screenshot from 2024-08-06 14-41-56.png#invert | center]]

**Example:** $\R^n$ is Hausdorff since any two distinct points can be put in disjoint balls $B(x,\epsilon)$ and $B(y,\epsilon$) for $\epsilon=d(x,y)/2$. Moreover, it is also normal.

> [!prp]
> Every singleton set in a Hausdorff space $S$ is closed.

**Proof:** Let $x\in S$. Notice that for any $y\in S\setminus\{x\}$ there is open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $U\cap V=\emptyset$, $x\in U$ and $y\in V$. Notice that $V\subseteq S\setminus U\subseteq S\setminus\{x\}$. Therefore, $S\setminus\{x\}$ is open implying that $\{x\}$ is closed.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

> [!prp]
> Any subspace $A$ of a Hausdorff space $S$ is Hausdorff.

**Proof:** Let $x,y\in A$ be distinct points. Then $x,y\in S$ so there are disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x\in U$ and $y\in V$. Notice that $x\in U\cap A$, $y\in V\cap A$ and
$$
	(U\cap A)\cap(V\cap A) = (U\cap V)\cap A \subseteq U\cap V = \emptyset.
$$
Therefore, $A$ is Hausdorff.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>
# Product Topology

Given two topological spaces $X,Y$. Consider the collection $\cal{B}$ of subsets of $X\times Y$ where $U\subset X$ is open in $X$ and $V\subset Y$ is open in $Y$. Then $\cal{B}$ is the basis for a topology on $X\times Y$ known as the **product topology**.

> [!prp]
> Let $\{U_i\}$ and $\{V_i\}$ be bases for topological spaces $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Then $\{U_i\times V_j\}$ is a basis for $X\times Y$.

**Proof:** Let $W$ be open in $X\times Y$ and $(x,y)\in W$. Since $W$ is open, there is an open set $U\times V$ in $X\times Y$ such that $(x,y)\in U\times V\subseteq W$ where $U$ is open in $X$ and $V$ is open in $Y$. Notice that there is some $i$ such that $x\in U_i\subset U$ and $j$ such that $y\in V_j\subset V$. Therefore,
$$
	(x,y)\in U_i\times V_j \subset U\times V \subset W.
$$
Therefore, $\{U_i\times V_j\}$ is a basis for $X\times Y$.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

**Example:** The collection of open rectangles $(a,b)\times(c,d)$ is a basis for $\R^2=\R\times\R$.

> [!cor]
> The product of two second-countable spaces is second-countable.

> [!prp] 
> The product of two Hausdorff spaces $X$ and $Y$ is Hausdorff.

**Proof:** Let $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2)\in X\times Y$. WLOG, assume that $x_1\ne x_2$. Since $X$ is Hausdorff, there are disjoint open sets $U_1,U_2\in X$ such that $x_1\in U_1$ and $x_2\in U_2$. Notice that $U_1\times Y$ and $U_2\times Y$ are disjoint neighborhoods of $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, respectively.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

# Continuity

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a function between topological spaces. We say that $f$ is **continuous at a point $p$** in $X$ if for every neighborhood $V$ of $f(p)$ in $Y$, there is a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ in $X$ such that $f(U)\subset V$.

> [!prp]
> A function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continous if and only if $f^{-1}(V)$ is open for any open set $V$.

> [!cor]
> A function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous if and only if $f^{-1}(V)$ is closed for any closed set $V$.

**Example:** If $A$ is a subspace of $X$, then the inclusion map $i:A\hookrightarrow X$, $i(a)=a$, is continuous. Indeed, if $U$ is open in $X$, then $i^{-1}(U)=U\cap A$ is open in $A$.

**Example:** The projection map $\pi:X\times Y\rightarrow X$ given by $\pi(x,y)=x$ is continuous. Indeed, if $U$ is open in $X$, then $\pi^{-1}(U)=U\times Y$ is open in $X\times Y$.

> [!prp]
> The composition of two continuous maps is continuous.

**Proof:** Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and $g:Y\rightarrow Z$ be continuous. Then for $U$ open in $Z$,
$$
	(f\circ g)^{-1}(U) = g^{-1}(f^{-1}(U))
$$
is open in $X$ since $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $Y$.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>


> [!cor]
> The restriction $f|_A$ of a continuous function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ to a subspace $A$ is continuous.

**Proof:** The restriction $f|_A$ is the composition $f\circ i$ where $i:A\hookrightarrow X$ is the inclusion map.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

We call a map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ **open** if the image of every open set in $X$ is open in $Y$. Likewise, it is called **closed** if the image of every closed set in $X$ is closed in $Y$.

# Compactness

We call a collection $\{U_\alpha\}$ of open sets an **open cover** of $S$ if $S\subset\bigcup_\alpha U_\alpha$. A **subcover** is a subcollection of an open cover that still contains $S$. We say a topological space is **compact** if every open cover has a finite subcover.

**Example:** Any closed interval $[a,b]\subset\R$ is compact.

> [!prp]
> A subspace $A$ of a topological space $S$ is compact if and only if every open cover of $A$ in $S$ has a finite subcover.

> [!prp]
> A closed subset $F$ of a compact topological space $S$ is compact.

**Proof:** Let $\{U_\alpha\}$ be an open cover of $F$. Notice then that $\{U_\alpha\}\cup\{S\backslash F\}$ is a open cover of $S$. Since $S$ is compact, there is a finite subcover $U_1,\dots,U_n,S\backslash F$. Thus, $F\subset\bigcup U_i$.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

> [!prp]
> In a Hausdorff space $S$, it is possible to separate a compact subset $K$ and a point $p\not\in K$ by disjoint open sets, i.e., there exists an open set $U\supset K$ and a neighborhood $V$ of $p$ such that $U\cap V=\emptyset$.

**Proof:** Since $S$ is Hausdorff, for each $x\in K$ there are disjoint neighborhoods $U_x$ of $x$ and $V_x$ of $p$. Notice that $\{U_x\}$ forms an open cover of $K$, hence there is a finite subcover $U_{x_1},\dots,U_{x_n}$. Let $U=\bigcup U_{x_i}$ and $V=\bigcap V_{x_i}$. Notice that $U$ is open and $K\subset U$. Moreover $V$ is open and $p\in V$ since each $V_i$ contains $p$. Notice that
$$
	U \cap V = \bigcup_i(U_{x_i}\cap V) = \bigcup_i\emptyset = \emptyset.
$$
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

> [!prp]
> Every compact subset $K$ of a Hausdorff space $S$ is closed.

**Proof:** Let $p\in S\setminus K$. By the previous proposition, there is an open set $V$ containing $p$ such that $V\cap K=\emptyset$. Thus, $S\setminus K$ is open.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

> [!prp]
> The image of a compact set under a continuous map is compact.

**Proof:** Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a continuous map and $K$ a compact subset of $X$. Consider an open cover $\{V_\alpha\}$ of $f(K)$. Since $f$ is continuous, $\{f^{-1}(V_\alpha)\}$ is a collection of open sets in $X$. Notice that
$$
	\bigcup_\alpha f^{-1}(V_\alpha) = f^{-1}\left(\bigcup_\alpha V_\alpha\right) \supset f^{-1}(f(K)) \supset K
$$
Thus, there is a finite subcover $\{f^{-1}(V_1),\dots,f^{-1}(V_n)\}$ of $K$. Notice that
$$
		\bigcup_{i=1}^nf(f^{-1}(V_i)) = f\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^nf^{-1}(V_i)\right) \supset f(K).
$$
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>
> [!prp]
> A continuous map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ from a compact space $X$ to a Haudorff space $Y$ is a closed map.

**Proof:** Let $F$ be closed in $X$. By proposition 22, $F$ is compact. By proposition 25, $f(F)$ is compact. By proposition 24, $f(F)$ is closed.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

A continuous bijection $f:X\rightarrow Y$ whose inverse is also continuous is called a **homeomorphism**.

> [!cor]
> A continuous bijection $f:X\rightarrow Y$ from a compact space $X$ to a Hausdorff space $Y$ is a homeomorphism.

> [!thm]
> The product of compact spaces is compact in the product topology.

# Boundedness in $\R^n$

A subset $A$ of $\R^n$ is called **bounded** if there is an open ball $B(p,r)$ containing $A$. Otherwise it is **unbounded**.

> [!prp]
> A compact subset of $\R^n$ is bounded.

**Proof:** Let $K$ be a compact subset and consider the open cover $\{B(0,r)\}_{r=1}^\infty$ of $K$. Since $K$ is compact, it follows that $K$ is contained in a single ball $B(0,r')$.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

> [!thm] Heine-Borel
> A subset of $\R^n$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.


# Connectedness

> [!def] Connected/Disconnected
> A topological space $S$ is **disconnected** if it is the union $S=U\cup V$ of two disjoint nonempty open subsets $U$ and $V$. It is **connected** if it is not disconnected. 
> 

A subset $A$ is disconnected if it is disconnected in the subspace topology.

> [!prp]
> A subset $A$ of a topological space $S$ is disconnected if and only if there are open sets $U$ and $V$ in $S$ such that
> 1. $U\cap A\ne\emptyset, V\cap A\ne\emptyset$
> 2. $U\cap V\cap A=\emptyset$
> 3. $A\subset U\cup V$
> 
> A pair of open sets in $S$ with these properties is called a **separation** of $A$.

**Proof:**
$(\Rightarrow$): If $A$ is disconnected, then there are disjoint non-empty open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $A=U\cup V$. Thus, there are open sets $U',V'$ in $S$ such that $U=U'\cap A$, $V=V'\cap A$. Notice that
$$
	\emptyset = U\cap V = (U'\cap A)\cap(V'\cap A) = U'\cap V'\cap A
$$
and
$$
	A = U\cup V = (U'\cap A)\cup (V'\cap A) \subset U'\cup V'.
$$

($\Leftarrow$): Let $U'=U\cap A$ and $V'=V\cap A$. Notice that $U',V'$ are open in $A$,
$$
	U'\cap V' = (U\cap A)\cap(V\cap A) = \emptyset
$$
and
$$
	U'\cup V' = (U\cap A)\cup(V\cup A) = (U\cup V)\cap A = A.
$$
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

> [!prp]
> The image of a connected space $X$ under a continuous map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is connected.

# Closure

Let $S$ be a topological space and $A$ a subset of $S$. The **closure** of $A$ in $S$, denoted $\overline{A}$ or $\textup{cl}(A)$, is defined to be the intersection of all closed sets containing $A$. In other words, it is the smallest closed set containing $A$.

**Example:** The closure of the open disk $B(0,r)$ in $\R^2$ is the closed disk
$$
	\overline{B}(0,r) = \{p\in\R^2\mid d(p,0)\le r\}.
$$

> [!prp]
> Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $S$. A point $p\in S$ is in the closure $\textup{cl}A$ if and only if every neighborhood of $p$ contains a point of $A$.

![[Screenshot from 2024-08-07 14-32-05.png#invert | center]]

**Proof:** We prove the contrapositive.

$(\Rightarrow$): Suppose
$$
	p\not\in \textup{cl}(A) =\bigcap\{F\text{ closed in }S\mid F\supset A\}
$$
Then $p\in S\setminus F$ for some closed set $F$ in $S$. But $S\setminus F$ is open and disjoint from $A$.

$(\Leftarrow$): Let $p$ be in a open set $U$ disjoint from $A$. Notice that then $F=S\setminus U$ is a closed set containing $A$ and not containing $p$. Thus, $p\not\in\textup{cl}A$.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>
We call a point $p\in S$ an **accumulation point** of $A$ if every neighborhood of $p$ in $S$ contains a point of $A$ other than $p$. We denote the set of accumulation points by $\textup{ac} A$. Some texts refer to accumulation points as **limit points**.

**Example:** For $A=[0,1)\cup\{2\}$in $\R$, the closure of $A$ is $[0,1]\cup\{2\}$ but the set of accumulation points of $A$ is $[0,1]$.

> [!prp]
> Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space $S$. Then $\textup{cl}A=A\cup\textup{ac}(A)$.

# Convergence

Let $S$ be a topological space. A **sequence** in $S$ is a map from the set $\N$ to $S$. We typically write $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ or $x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots$.

We say a sequence **converges** to $p$ if for every neighborhood $U$ of $p$, there is some $N$ such that $n\ge N$ implies that $x_n\in U$. We often write this as $x_n\rightarrow p$ or $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}x_n=p$. Not every sequence converges, in such a case we say it **diverges**. For example the sequence $-1,1,-1,1,\dots$ in $\R$ diverges.

> [!prp]
> Let $S$ be a Hausdorff space. If $\{x_n\}$ converges to $p$ and to $q$, then $p=q$.

**Proof:** Assume $p\ne q$. Then since $S$ is Hausdorff, there are neighborhoods $U$ and $V$ of $p$ and $q$ respectively such that $U\cap V=\emptyset$. Since $x_n\rightarrow p$ there is some $N_p$ such that $x_n\in U$ whenever $n\ge N_p$. Likewise, there is some $N_q$ such that $x_n\in V$ whenever $n\ge N_q$. Then it follows that for $n\ge\max\{N_p,N_q\}$, $x_n\in U\cap V=\emptyset$.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

This uniqueness property does not hold in general. The simplest counterexample is any non-empty set $X$ with the trivial topology $\cal{T}=\{\emptyset, X\}$. In such a space a sequence $\{x_n\}$ converges to every point $p\in X$.

> [!prp] The sequence lemma
> Let $S$ be a topological space and $A$ a subset of $S$. If there is a sequence $\{a_n\}$ in $A$ such that $a_n\rightarrow p$, then $p\in\textup{cl} A$. The converse is true if $S$ is first countable.
