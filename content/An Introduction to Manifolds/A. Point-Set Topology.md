> [!def] Topology
> A **topology** on a set $S$ is a collection $\cal{T}$ of subsets such that
> 1. $\emptyset,S\in \cal{T}$
> 2. (Arbitrary union) if $U_a\in\cal{T}$ for all $a\in A$, then $\bigcup_{a\in A}U_a\in\cal{T}$

We call elements of a topology **open sets** and the pair $(S,\cal{T})$ a **topological space**. A **neighborhood** of a point $p\in S$ is an open set $U$ that contains $p$.

**Example:** The standard topology for $\R^n$ consists of sets $U$ that are open if and only if for every $p\in U$, there is a open ball $B(p,\epsilon)$ with center $p$ and radius $\epsilon$ contained in $U$.

If $\cal{T}_1$ and $\cal{T}_2$ are both topologies of $S$ and $\cal{T}_1\subset\cal{T}_2$, then we say that $\cal{T}_2$ is **coarser** than $\cal{T}_1$. Or equivalently, $\cal{T}_1$ is **finer** than $\cal{T}_2$.

> [!lemma] Local criterion for openness
> Let $S$ be a topological space. A subset $A$ is open in $S$ if and only if for every $p\in A$, there is an open set $V$ such that $p\in V\subseteq A$.

**Proof:**
($\Rightarrow$): Clearly $p\in A\subseteq A$ for all $p\in A$.
($\Leftarrow$): Notice that for each $p\in A$ there is a open set $V_p\subset A$. But,
$$
	A = \bigcup_{p\in A}V_p
$$
and the arbitrary union of open sets is open.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

A set $V$ is called **closed** if it's complement $S\backslash V$ is open. By the use of de Morgan's laws, one can redefine a topology in terms of closed sets.

> 1. $\emptyset$ and $S$ are closed
> 2. (Arbitrary intersection) if $U_a$ is closed for all $a\in A$, then $\bigcap_{a\in A}U_a$ is closed.

# Subspace Topology

Let $(S,\cal{T})$ be a topological space and $A\subseteq S$. Define $\cal{T}_A$ to be the collection of subsets
$$
	\cal{T}_A = \{U\cap A\mid U\in\cal{T}\}.
$$
By the distributive property of union and intersection, one may show that $\cal{T}_A$ is closed under arbitrary union and finite intersection. Moreover, $\emptyset,A\in\cal{T}_A$. Thus, $\cal{T}_A$ is a topology on $A$ called the **subspace topology**.

**Example:** Consider the subset $A=[0,1]$ of $\R$. In the subspace topology, the half-open interval $[0,1/2)$ is open relative to $A$ since
$$
	[0,1/2) = (-1/2,1/2)\cap A
$$
and $(-1/2,1/2)$ is open in $\R$.

# Bases

Instead of explicitly stating all the possible open sets, we often make use of the local criterion for openness and define a basis of sets.

> [!def] Basis
> A subcollection $\cal{B}$ of a topology $\cal{T}$ on a topological space $S$ is a **basis** for $\cal{T}$ if given an open set $U$ and a point $p\in U$, there is an open set $B\in\cal{B}$ such that $p\in B\subset U$. We say that $\cal{B}$ **generates** the topology $\cal{T}$.

**Example:** The standard topology for $\R^n$ is generated by the collection of open balls
$$
	B(p,r) = \{x\in\R^n\mid d(p,x)<r\}
$$
for all $p\in\R^n$ and $r\in\R$.

> [!prp]
> A collection $\cal{B}$ of open sets of $S$ is a basis if and only if every open set in $S$ is a union of sets in $\cal{B}$.

**Proof:**
($\Rightarrow$): Let $U$ be open. Since $\cal{B}$ is a basis, there are open sets $V_p\in\cal{B}$ for each $p\in U$. Notice that
$$
	U = \bigcup_{p\in U}V_p.
$$
$(\Leftarrow$): Let $U$ be open and $p\in U$. Since $U=\bigcup_{a\in A}V_a$ with each $V_a\in\cal{B}$, there is some $a\in A$ such that $p\in V_a$. Thus, $\cal{B}$ is a basis.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

> [!prp]
> A collection $\cal{B}$ of subsets of a set $S$ is a basis for some topology $\cal{T}$ on $S$ if and only if
> 1. $S$ is the union of all sets in $\cal{B}$; and
> 2. given any two sets $B_1,B_2\in\cal{B}$ and a point $p\in B_1\cap B_2$, there is a set $B\in\cal{B}$ such that $p\in B\subset B_1\cap B_2$.

![[Screenshot from 2024-08-06 14-11-57.png#invert | center]]

**Proof:**
($\Rightarrow$): 
1. See previous proposition.
2. Since $\cal{B}$ is a basis, $B_1,B_2$ and $B_1\cap B_2$ are open. Hence, by the definition of basis, there is a $B\in\cal{B}$ such that $p\in B\subset B_1\cap B_2$.

($\Leftarrow$): Let $\cal{T}$ be the collection of all sets that unions of set sin $\cal{B}$. Note that $\emptyset, S\in\cal{T}$. Clearly, an arbitrary union of sets in $\cal{T}$ is in $\cal{T}$. For finite intersection, let $U=\bigcup_\mu B_\mu$ and $V=\bigcup_\nu B_\nu$ be sets in $\cal{T}$. Notice that
$$
	U\cap V = \left(\bigcup_\mu B_\mu\right)\cap\left(\bigcup_\nu B_\nu\right) = \bigcup_{\mu,\nu}(B_\mu\cap B_\nu).
$$
Hence, for any $p\in U\cap V$, it follows that $p\in B_\mu\cap B_\nu$ for some $\mu,\nu$. By property (2), there is a set $B_p\in\cal{B}$ such that $p\in B_p\subset B_\mu\cap B_\nu$. Therefore,
$$
	U\cap V = \bigcup_{p\in U\cap V}B_p.
$$
Hence, $\cal{T}$ is a topology.

> [!prp]
> Let $\cal{B}=\{B_\alpha\}$ be a basis for a topological space $S$, and $A$ a subspace of $S$. Then $\{B_\alpha\cap A\}$ is a basis for $A$.

**Proof:** Let $U$ be open relative to $A$, i.e., $U=U'\cap A$ for some open set $U'$ in $S$. Since $\cal{B}$ is a basis for $S$, it follows that $U'=\bigcup_\mu B_\mu$. Notice that
$$
	U = \left(\bigcup_\mu B_\mu\right)\cap A = \bigcup_\mu(B_\mu\cap A).
$$

# First and Second Countability

> [!def] Second countable
> A topological space is **second countable** if it has a countable basis.

**Example:** $\R^n$ is second countable since it is generated by the collection of open balls in $\R^n$ with rational centers and rational radii.

> [!prp]
> A subspace $A$ of a second-countable space $S$ is second countable.

**Proof:** Follows from proposition 7.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

> [!def] First Countable
> Let $S$ be a topological space and $p\in S$. A **basis of neighborhoods** at $p$ is a collection $\cal{B}=\{B_\alpha\}$ of neighborhoods of $p$ such that any neighborhood $U$ of $p$, there is a $B_\alpha\in\cal{B}$ such that $p\in B_\alpha\subseteq U$. A topological space $S$ is **first countable** if it has a countable basis of neighborhoods at every point $p\in S$.

**Example:** For any $p\in\R^n$, the collection $\{B(p,1/n)\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is a countable neighborhood basis at $p$. Thus, $\R^n$ is first countable.

**Example:** An uncountable discrete space is first countable but not second countable.

# Separation Axioms

> [!def] Hausdorff
> A topological space $S$ is **Hausdorff** if given any two distinct points $x,y\in S$, there exists disjoint open sets $U,V$ such that $x\in U$ and $y\in V$. A Hausdorff space is **normal** if given any two distinct closed sets $F,G$ in $S$, there exists disjoint open sets $U,V$ such that $F\subset U$ and $G\subset V$.

![[Screenshot from 2024-08-06 14-41-56.png#invert | center]]

**Example:** $\R^n$ is Hausdorff since any two distinct points can be put in disjoint balls $B(x,\epsilon)$ and $B(y,\epsilon$) for $\epsilon=d(x,y)/2$. Moreover, it is also normal.

> [!prp]
> Every singleton set in a Hausdorff space $S$ is closed.

**Proof:** Let $x\in S$. Notice that for any $y\in S\setminus\{x\}$ there is open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $U\cap V=\emptyset$, $x\in U$ and $y\in V$. Notice that $V\subseteq S\setminus U\subseteq S\setminus\{x\}$. Therefore, $S\setminus\{x\}$ is open implying that $\{x\}$ is closed.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

> [!prp]
> Any subspace $A$ of a Hausdorff space $S$ is Hausdorff.

**Proof:** Let $x,y\in A$ be distinct points. Then $x,y\in S$ so there are disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x\in U$ and $y\in V$. Notice that $x\in U\cap A$, $y\in V\cap A$ and
$$
	(U\cap A)\cap(V\cap A) = (U\cap V)\cap A \subseteq U\cap V = \emptyset.
$$
Therefore, $A$ is Hausdorff.

# Product Topology

Given two topological spaces $X,Y$. Consider the collection $\cal{B}$ of subsets of $X\times Y$ where $U\subset X$ is open in $X$ and $V\subset Y$ is open in $Y$. Then $\cal{B}$ is the basis for a topology on $X\times Y$ known as the **product topology**.

> [!prp]
> Let $\{U_i\}$ and $\{V_i\}$ be bases for topological spaces $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Then $\{U_i\times V_j\}$ is a basis for $X\times Y$.

**Proof:** Let $W$ be open in $X\times Y$ and $(x,y)\in W$. Since $W$ is open, there is an open set $U\times V$ in $X\times Y$ such that $(x,y)\in U\times V\subseteq W$ where $U$ is open in $X$ and $V$ is open in $Y$. Notice that there is some $i$ such that $x\in U_i\subset U$ and $j$ such that $y\in V_j\subset V$. Therefore,
$$
	(x,y)\in U_i\times V_j \subset U\times V \subset W.
$$
Therefore, $\{U_i\times V_j\}$ is a basis for $X\times Y$.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

**Example:** The collection of open rectangles $(a,b)\times(c,d)$ is a basis for $\R^2=\R\times\R$.

> [!cor]
> The product of two second-countable spaces is second-countable.

> [!prp] 
> The product of two Hausdorff spaces $X$ and $Y$ is Hausdorff.

**Proof:** Let $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2)\in X\times Y$. WLOG, assume that $x_1\ne x_2$. Since $X$ is Hausdorff, there are disjoint open sets $U_1,U_2\in X$ such that $x_1\in U_1$ and $x_2\in U_2$. Notice that $U_1\times Y$ and $U_2\times Y$ are disjoint neighborhoods of $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, respectively.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

# Continuity

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a function between topological spaces. We say that $f$ is **continuous at a point $p$** in $X$ if for every neighborhood $V$ of $f(p)$ in $Y$, there is a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ in $X$ such that $f(U)\subset V$.

> [!prp]
> A function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continous if and only if $f^{-1}(V)$ is open for any open set $V$.

> [!cor]
> A function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous if and only if $f^{-1}(V)$ is closed for any closed set $V$.

**Example:** If $A$ is a subspace of $X$, then the inclusion map $i:A\hookrightarrow X$, $i(a)=a$, is continuous. Indeed, if $U$ is open in $X$, then $i^{-1}(U)=U\cap A$ is open in $A$.

**Example:** The projection map $\pi:X\times Y\rightarrow X$ given by $\pi(x,y)=x$ is continuous. Indeed, if $U$ is open in $X$, then $\pi^{-1}(U)=U\times Y$ is open in $X\times Y$.

> [!prp]
> The composition of two continuous maps is continuous.

**Proof:** Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and $g:Y\rightarrow Z$ be continuous. Then for $U$ open in $Z$,
$$
	(f\circ g)^{-1}(U) = g^{-1}(f^{-1}(U))
$$
is open in $X$ since $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $Y$.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>


> [!cor]
> The restriction $f|_A$ of a continuous function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ to a subspace $A$ is continuous.

**Proof:** The restriction $f|_A$ is the composition $f\circ i$ where $i:A\hookrightarrow X$ is the inclusion map.
<p style='text-align: right'>Q.E.D.</p>

We call a map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ **open** if the image of every open set in $X$ is open in $Y$. Likewise, it is called **closed** if the image of every closed set in $X$ is closed in $Y$.
