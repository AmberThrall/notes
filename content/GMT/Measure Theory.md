# Rectangles

The main idea behind calculating the measure of a subset $A\subset\R^d$ is approximating the set $A$ with a union of geometrically simple shapes with known measure such has balls or rectangles.

A (closed) **rectangle** $R\subset\R^d$ is given by 
$$
	R = [a_1,b_1]\times[a_2,b_2]\times\cdots\times[a_d,b_d].
$$
Then the volume of a rectangle $R$ is 
$$
	|R| = \prod_{i=1}^d(b_i-a_i).
$$
We say a union of rectangles is **almost disjoint** if the interiors of the rectangles are disjoint.

> If a rectangle is the almost disjoint union of finitely many other rectangles, say $R=\bigcup_{k=1}^N R_k$, then

   |R| = \sum_{k=1}^N|R_k|.

If the rectangles are not almost disjoint, then 
$$
	|R| \le \sum_{k=1}^N|R_k|.
$$
> [!thm]
> Every open subset $\cal{O}$ of $\R$ can be written uniquely as a countable union of disjoint open intervals.

**Proof:** For each $x\in\cal{O}$, set $I_x$ to be the largest open interval containing $x$ and contained in $\cal{O}$. Define
$$
	a_x = \inf\{a<x:(a,x)\subset\cal{O}\}~\text{ and }~b_x=\sup\{b>x:(x,b)\in\cal{O}\}.
$$
Clearly, $a_x<x<b_x$ so if $I_x=(a_x,b_x)$ then $x\in I_x$ and $I_x\subset\cal{O}$. Thus,
$$
	\cal{O} = \bigcup_{x\in\cal{O}}I_x.
$$
If $I_x$ and $I_y$ intersect, then their $I_x\cup I_y\subset\cal{O}$ contains $x$. But we said that $I_x$ is maximal, so $I_x\cup I_y\subset I_x$ and $I_x\cup I_y\subset I_y$. Thus, $I_x=I_y$. Therefore, the collection of intervals $\cal{I}=\{I_x\}_{x\in\cal{O}}$ is disjoint. We also know this collection is countable as every open interval $I_x$ must contain a rational number.

This result generalizes to higher dimensions.

# The Exterior Measure

Let $E$ be a subset of $\R^d$. Then the **exterior/outer measure** of $E$ is
$$
	m_*(E) = \inf\sum_{j=1}^\infty|Q_j|
$$
where the infimum is taken over all countable covers $E\subset\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty Q_j$ of closed cubes.

For example, let $E$ be a closed cube. Clearly $E$ covers itself so $m_*(E)\le|E|$. Let $E\subset\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty Q_j$ be an arbitrary covering of $E$ by cubes and let $\epsilon>0$. For each $j$, we choose an open cube $S_j$ containing $Q_j$ such that $|S_j|\le(1+\epsilon)|Q_j|$. This forms an open cover of $E$, a compact set. Thus, there is a finite subcover $E\subset\bigcup_{j=1}^NS_j$. So
$$
	|E| \le \sum_{j=1}^N|S_j| \le (1+\epsilon)\sum_{j=1}^N|Q_j|.
$$
Therefore, $|E|\le m_*(E)$.

## Properties

Clearly by the definition, for every $\epsilon>0$ there is a cover $E\subset\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty Q_j$ such that
$$
	\sum_{j=1}^\infty m_*(Q_j) \le m_*(E) + \epsilon.
$$

Some useful properties:

1. **Monotonicity:** If $E_1\subset E_2$, then $m_*(E_1)\le m_*(E_2)$.
2. **Countable sub-additivity:** If $E=\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty E_j$, then $m_*(E)\le\sum_{j=1}^\infty m_*(E_j)$.
3. If $E\subset\R^d$, then $m_*(E)=\inf m_*(\cal{O})$ where the infimum is taken over all open sets $\cal{O}$ containing $E$.
4. If $E=E_1\cup E_2$ and $\inf_{e_1\in E_1, e_2\in E_2} d(e_1,e_2) > 0$, then $m_*(E) = m_*(E_1) + m_*(E_2)$.
5. If $E$ is a countable union of almost disjoint cubes $E=\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty Q_j$, then $m_*(E)=\sum_{j=1}^\infty |Q_j|$.

# Measurable Sets and the Lebesgue Measure

We say a subset $E\subset\R^d$ is **Lebesgue measurable** if for any $\epsilon>0$ there exists an open set $\cal{O}$ with $E\subset\cal{O}$ and
$$
	m_*(\cal{O} - E) \le \epsilon.
$$
If $E$ is measurable, we define it's **Lebesgue measure** to be $m(E)=m_*(E)$. In other words, the Lebesgue measure is simply the outer measure restricted to measurable sets. Clearly, properties 1-5 above still hold. Moreover, it is clear that every open set in $\R^d$ is measurable as $m_*(\cal{O}-\cal{O})=m_*(\emptyset)=0\le\epsilon$. This also holds for closed sets $F$.

Notice that for any set $E$ with $m_*(E)=0$, we get that $E$ is measurable. Indeed, for every $\epsilon>0$ it follows by property 3 that we can choose an open set $\cal{O}\supset E$ with $m_*(\cal{O})\le\epsilon$. Then by monotonicity,
$$
	m_*(\cal{O}-E) \le m_*(\cal{O}) \le \epsilon.
$$

We also get that a countable union of measurable sets is measurable. If $E_j$ is a countable collection of measurable sets, then there is another countable collection $\cal{O}_j$ of open sets such that $E_j\subset\cal{O}_j$ and $m_*(\cal{O}_j-E_j)\le \epsilon/2^j$. Thus,
$$
	m_*(\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty\cal{O}_j-\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty E_j) \le \sum_{j=1}^nm_*(\cal{O}_j-E_j) \le \epsilon.
$$

> [!thm]
> If $E_1,E_2,\dots$ are disjoint measurable sets, then
> $$
> 	m\left(\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty E_j\right) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty m(E_j).

Notice that this result does not hold for the outer measure!

Some more properties:
- The complement of a measurable set is measurable
- A countable intersection of measurable sets is measurable
- If $E_k\nearrow E$, then $m(E)=\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}m(E_k)$.
- If $E_k\searrow E$ and $m(E_k)<\infty$ for some $k$, then $m(E)=\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}m(E_k)$.
