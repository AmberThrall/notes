Let $X^0$ be a discrete set, whose points we call **0-cells**. We can inductively define an **$n$-skeleton**, $X^n$, to be given by attaching **$n$-cells** $e_\alpha^n\cong B^n$ via maps $\phi_\alpha:\partial \overline{e_\alpha^n}\cong S^{n-1}\rightarrow X^{n-1}$. In looser terms, the $n$-skeleton $X^n$ can be viewed by the set
$$
	X^n = X^{n-1}\sqcup_\alpha e_\alpha^n
$$
where $(e_\alpha^n)_\alpha$ are a collections of topological spaces homeomorphic to an open unit ball $B^n$. The collection of $n$-skeletons, $X=\bigcup_n X^n$ is called a **cell complex** or **CW complex**. A cell complex has a weak topology defined by $A\subset X$ is open (or closed) if and only if $A\cap X^n$ is open (or closed) in $X^n$ for each $n$.

Like simplicial complexes, one may compute the **Euler characteristic** of a cellular complex:
$$
	\sum_{k=0}^{\dim X}(-1)^k|X^k|.
$$
For instance, a 2-sphere would have Euler characteristic $\chi=1-0+1=2$.

### Examples of Cell Complexes

- A graph is an example of a 1-dimensional cell complex, where the vertices are 0-cells and the attached edges are 1-cells. More precisely, edges can be viewed as the interval $(0,1)$ glued to vertices by the map $\phi:\partial[0,1]=\{0,1\}\rightarrow X^0$. If both boundary points map to the same vertex, then the edge is a loop.
- The $n$-sphere, $S^n$, is a $n$-dimensional cell complex with a single 0-cell, $e^0$, and a single $n$-cell, $e^n\cong B^n$, glued by the constant map $\phi:\partial D^n=S^{n-1}\rightarrow e^0$. This gluing can be viewed as collapsing the boundary to a single point, which gives a $n$-sphere. For instance, $S^1$ can be viewed as taking $D^1=[0,1]$ and gluing the boundary $\{0,1\}\rightarrow e^0$ to a single point, giving a circle.
- Every simplicial complex $K=\bigcup K_n$ is a cell complex where $n$-cells are given by the interior of $k$-simplices, $\{e_\sigma^n=\mathring{\sigma}:\sigma\in K_n\}$, with attaching inclusion maps $\varphi_\sigma:\partial \overline{e_\sigma^n}\hookrightarrow X^{n-1}$ which glues each boundary face to its corresponding $(n-1)$-cell.

### Singular Homology

Recall that a **singular $n$-simplex** in a space $X$ is simply a map $\sigma:\Delta^n\rightarrow X$, where $\Delta^n$ is the standard $n$-simplex given by
$$
	\Delta^n = \left\{(t_0,\dots,t_n)\in\R^{n+1}\mid\sum_{i=0}^nt_i=1\text{ and }t_i\ge0,\forall i=0,\dots,n\right\},
$$
i.e., the $n$-simplex given by the standard basis vectors $e_i$ for $\R^{n+1}$. Let $C_n(X)$ be the free abelian group generated by the set of singular $n$-simplices in $X$. Each element of $C_n(X)$, called **singular $n$-chain**, is simply a formal sum $\sigma=\sum_i n_i\sigma_i$ for $n_i\in\Z$ and $\sigma_i:\Delta^n\rightarrow X$.

Define the **singular boundary map** $\partial_n:C_n(X)\rightarrow C_{n-1}(X)$ in the same fashion as simplicial boundary map:
$$
	\partial_n(\sigma) = \sum_i(-1)^i\sigma|[v_0,\dots,\hat{v_i},\dots,v_n]
$$
where $\sigma|[v_0,\dots,\hat{v_i},\dots,v_n]:\Delta^{n-1}\rightarrow X$ is the map $\sigma$ restricted to the face $[v_0,\dots,\hat{v_i},\dots,v_n]$. One may show that $\partial_n\partial_{n+1}=0$.

Hence, we define the **singular homology group** by $H_n(X)=\textup{Ker}\partial_n/\textup{Im}\partial_{n+1}$.

#### Relative Homology

Let $X$ be a space with subspace $A\subset X$. Then the **relative chain group** is given by $C_n(X,A)=C_n(X)/C_n(A)$. Note that the boundary map $\partial:C_n(X)\rightarrow C_{n-1}(X)$ maps $C_n(A)\rightarrow C_{n-1}(A)$. Thus, there is an induced boundary map $\partial:C_n(X,A)\rightarrow C_{n-1}(X,A)$ which still satisfies $\partial^2=0$.

Consequently, one may define the **relative homology group** $H_n(X,A)=\textup{Ker}\partial_n/\textup{Im}\partial_{n+1}$. In simpler terms, elements of $H_n(X,A)$ are representatives of **relative cycles**: $n$-chains $\alpha\in C_n(X)$ such that $\partial\alpha\in C_{n-1}(A)$.
### Homology of Cell Complexes

Let $X$ be a cellular complex. Then one gets the following **cellular chain complex**
$$
	\cdots\rightarrow H_{n+1}(X^{n+1},X^n)\xrightarrow{d_{n+1}}H_n(X^n,X^{n-1})\xrightarrow{d_n}H_{n-1}(X^{n-1},X^{n-2})\rightarrow\cdots
$$
where $d_{n+1}$ is given by $H_{n+1}(X^{n+1},X^n)\xrightarrow{\partial_{n+1}}H_n(X^n)\xrightarrow{j_n}H_n(X^n,X^{n-1})$ and $d_n$ is given by $H_n(X^n,X^{n-1})\xrightarrow{\partial_n}H_{n-1}(X^{n-1})\xrightarrow{j_{n-1}}H_{n-1}(X^{n-1},X^{n-2})$. One may view $H_n(X^n,X^{n-1})$ as the free abelian group generated by the $n$-cells in $X$. Then the **cellular homology groups** of $X$ are given by $H_n^{CW}(X)=\textup{Ker}d_n/\textup{Im}d_{n+1}$.

> $H_n^{CW}(X)\cong H_n(X)$.

Consider a map $f:S^n\rightarrow S^n$. There is an induced homomorphism $f_*:H_n(S^n)\rightarrow H_n(S^n)$ of the form $f_*(\alpha)=d\alpha$ for some $d\in\Z$ depending on $f$. The integer $d$ is called the **degree** of $f$, and denoted $\textup{deg } f$. Some useful properties:
- If $f$ is not surjective, then $\textup{deg }f=0$
- $\textup{deg }fg=\textup{deg }f\textup{deg }g$
- $f\cong g$ if and only if $\textup{deg }f=\textup{deg }g$
- If $f$ is a reflection of $S^n$, then $\textup{deg }f=-1$.

The cellular boundary map $d_n$ can be computed by
$$
	d_n(e^n_\alpha) = \sum_\beta d_{\alpha\beta}e_\beta^{n-1}
$$
where $d_{\alpha\beta}$ is the degree of the map $S^{n-1}_\alpha\rightarrow X^{n-1}\rightarrow S^{n-1}_\beta$, i.e., the composition of attaching map $\phi_\alpha:S_\alpha^{n-1}\rightarrow X_{n-1}$ and the quotient map $q_\beta:X^{n-1}\rightarrow X^{n-1}/(X^{n-1}-e_\beta^{n-1})\cong S_\beta^{n-1}$ which collapses everything but $e_\beta^{n-1}$ to a point. Geometrically, $d_{\alpha\beta}$ measures how many times (and direction) the boundary of $e_\alpha^n$ winds around $e_\beta^{n-1}$.

### Examples

 - Consider the cellular complex for $S^1$: a single 0-cell, $e^0$ and a single $1$-cell, $e^1$, glued by the constant map $S^0\rightarrow e^0$. Then the chain complex would be given by $\Z\rightarrow\Z\rightarrow0\rightarrow\cdots$. In computing the homology, notice that $d_1(k\cdot e^1)=k\cdot d_1(e^1)=k\cdot(e^0-e^0)=0$. Hence, $H_1(S^1)=0$ and $H_0(S^1)=\Z$.
