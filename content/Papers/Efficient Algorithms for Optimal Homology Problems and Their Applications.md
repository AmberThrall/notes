- They focus on co-dimension 1, where $\textup{dim}z=\textup{dim}\cal{K}-1$, with homology defined over $\Z$
- Flat norm measures distances between shapes with applications in image analysis and denoising.
- **multiscale Simplicial Flat Norm** (mSFN) is a discretization of flat norm by a simplicial complex indexed by a scale parameter $\lambda\ge0$.
- OHCP corresponds to special case of mSFN with $\lambda=0$

# Preliminaries

- Focus is on finite $(q+1)$-connected orientable $(q+1)$-complexes that can be embedded into $\R^{q+1}$.
- A $d$-complex $\cal{K}$ is **pure** if every $(d-1)$-simplex has at least one $d$-coface in $\cal{K}$.
- If every $(d-1)$-simplex has at most two cofaces, then $\cal{K}$ is called a **weak $d$-pseudomanifold**.
- Two $d$-simplices $\sigma_0$ and $\sigma_k$ are **$d$-connected** on $\cal{K}$ if there is a sequence of $d$-simplices such that any two consecutive simplices share a $(d-1)$-face, i.e., $(\sigma_j\cap\sigma_{j+1})\in\cal{K}^{d-1}$.
- An **embedding** $\lfloor\sigma\rfloor$ of a $d$-simplex, $d\le q+1$, is an injection into a subspace of $\R^{q+1}$, called **$d$-cell**, that is homeomorphic to a $d$-dimensional closed ball.
	- An embedding of a whole complex $\lfloor\cal{K}\rfloor$ is a collection of embeddings such that if $\sigma\cap\tau\in\cal{K}$ then $\lfloor\sigma\rfloor\cap\lfloor\tau\rfloor=\lfloor\sigma\cap\tau\rfloor$.
	- A valid embedding $\lfloor\cal{K}\rfloor$ gives rise to a **CW-complex** given by downwardly closed $(q+1)$-cells
	- Every embeddable complex is a weak pseudomanifold, but not every weak pseudomanifold is embeddable.
- The **positive** or **natural orientation** of $\sigma_i$, denoted $\vec{\sigma}_{+i}$, is the class of evenly permuted orientations.
	- $\vec{\cal{K}}_d^+=\{\vec{\sigma}_{+i}\mid \sigma_i\in\cal{K}_d\}$ is the positive $d$-skeleton consisting of all positive orientated $d$-simplices.
	- $\vec{\cal{K}}_d=\vec{\cal{K}}_d^+\cup\vec{\cal{K}}_d^-$ gives a **directed $d$-skeleton**.
	- The **orientation function** $\Omega_d:\vec{\cal{K}}_d\rightarrow\{-1,1\}$ maps positively oriented simplices to 1 and negatively oriented simplices to -1.

## Simplicial Homology

- A **$d$-chain** on $\cal{K}$ is a formal sum of $d$-simplices of $\cal{K}$ with coefficients of scalar group $\bb{K}$
	- Focus is over $\bb{K}=\Z$ for oriented complexes or $\bb{K}=\Z^+$ for directed $d$-complexes
- A **$d$-cochain** is a $\bb{K}$-valued homomorphism $f:\cal{K}_d\rightarrow\bb{K}$.
- We call a $d$-(co)chain **simple** if it has no more than unit values for $d$-simplices, i.e., coefficients are in $\{-1,0,1\}$.
- Chain and cochain groups: $\cal{C}_d(\cal{K};\bb{K})$ and $\cal{C}^d(\cal{K};\bb{K})$
	- $\cal{C}_d$ is generated by individual $d$-simplices. This basis is denoted $[\cal{C}_d(\cal{K})]$
	- $\cal{C}^d$ is generated by elementary $d$-cochains that map all but one simplex to zero
	- $\cal{C}_d\cong\cal{C}^d\cong\Z^{|\cal{K}_d|}$
- **$d$-boundary operator** is a homomorphism $\partial_d:\cal{C}_d\rightarrow\cal{C}_{d-1}$ given by
$$
	\partial_d\tau = \sum_{j=0}^d(-1)^j[v_0,v_1,\dots,\hat{v_j},\dots,v_d]
$$
- The **group of $d$-boundaries** is given by the image 
$$\cal{B}_d(\cal{K})=\textup{Im}\partial_{d+1}=\{w\in\cal{C}_d(\cal{K})\mid \exists v\in\cal{C}_{d+1}(\cal{K})\text{ s.t. }w = \partial_{d+1}v\}$$
- The **group of $d$-cycles** is given by the kernel
$$\cal{Z}_d(\cal{K})=\textup{ker}\partial_d=\{z\in\cal{C}_d(\cal{K})\mid\partial_dz=0\}$$
- We say a $d$-cycle is **non-bounding** or **non-trivial** if $z\in\cal{Z}_d(\cal{K})\setminus\cal{B}_d(\cal{K})$.
- The **$d$-coboundary operator** $\delta_d:\cal{C}^{d-1}(\cal{K})\rightarrow\cal{C}^d(\cal{K})$ is the dual of $\partial_d$ and is given by
$$
	\delta_d\sigma = \sum_{\tau\supset\sigma}(-1)^j[v_0,v_1,\dots,\tilde{u}_j,\dots,v_{d-1}]
$$
where $\tilde{u_j}$ means that $u_j$ was inserted into the $j$-th position.
- $[\delta_d]=[\partial_d]^\top$
- Some sources refer to $d$-cycles as **flows** and call the equation $\partial_dz=0$ the **flow conservation condition**.
	- In relation to $d$-cocycles $f\in\cal{Z}^d(\cal{K})$, we call them **$d$-coflows** and $\delta_{d+1}f=0$ as **circulation conservation**.
- One may view $d$-coflows $f\in\cal{Z}^d(\cal{K})$ as functions $f:\cal{Z}_d(\cal{K})\rightarrow\Z$ such that $\cal{B}_d(\cal{K})\mapsto0$
	- We call the value $f(z)$ **coflux of $f$ through $z$**.
- **Hodge Decomposition:** $q$-boundaries always have 0 coflux through any cycle $z$

> A **$d$-copath** $p=p(\eta,\tau)$ between two $(d+1)$-simplices $\eta,\tau\in\cal{K}_{d+1}$ is a simple $d$-cochain $p\in\cal{C}^d(\cal{K})$ with nonempty coboundary $\delta_{d+1}p=\tau - \eta$. We call the $(d+1)$-facets of $\eta$ and $\tau$ the endpoints of $p$.
