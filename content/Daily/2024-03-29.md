Section 4 of the paper [[Steinhaus Filtration and Stable Paths in the Mapper]] claims that (under certain conditions) the cover filtration is isomorphic to Cech and VR filtrations. It starts with the following conjecture:

> [!conjecture] Cech equivalence
> Given a finite data set $X\subset\R^n$ and some radius $R>\textup{diam}(X)$ the Cech filtration constructed from $X$ is isomorphic to the cover filtration on $X$ constructed from $C_R(X)$, given the Lebesgue measure.

In the conjecture above, $C_R(X)$ is the cover of $X$ by balls of radius $R$. Clearly, the nerve of $C_R(x)$ is the Cech complex. One gets the Cech filtration by varying the radius $R$.

I want to explore more what this conjecture is stating, i.e., what does it mean for two filtrations to be isomorphic?

The following is my *educated guess*:

Two filtrations 
$$
    A_0 \subset A_1 \subset A_2 \subset \cdots \subset A_m
$$
and
$$
    B_0 \subset B_1 \subset B_2 \subset \cdots \subset B_n
$$
are **isomorphic** if $m=n$ and there exists bijections $\varphi_i:A_i\rightarrow B_i$ for all $i=0,1,2,\dots,m$.

Under this definition, the conjecture is claiming that there are bijections
$$
    \varphi_i:K^{t_i}\rightarrow\textup{\v{C}ech}(r_i)
$$
where $K^{t_i}:=\{\sigma\in\textup{Nrv}_{St}(\cal{U}):w_\sigma\le t_i\}$.

The paper doesn't provide a general proof, but it does provide a proof for the $n$-skeleton of a data set $X\subset\R$. They construct a bijection between birth times. Notice that for the Cech filtration, the birth radius of the simplex defined by the set of vertices $\{v_i\}$ is given by 
$$
    C(\{v_i\}) = \frac{\max_i(v_i)-\min_i(v_i)}{2},
$$
i.e, when the balls around the two outer most points intersect.

If $\{V_i\}$ is the set of balls of radius $R$ centered on the set $\{v_i\}$, then the Steinhaus distance (recall we are using Lebesgue measure) is
$$
    d_{St}(\{V_i\}) = 1-\frac{\mu(\bigcap V_i)}{\mu(\bigcup V_i)} = 1 - \frac{\min_i(v_i+R)-\max_i(v_i-R)}{\max_i(v_i+R)-\min_i(v_i-R)}.
$$
This can be seen with the visualization below:

The union is the long lower orange line, whereas the intersection is the blue line above it.

After some basic manipulation, we get that 
$$
    C(\{v_i\}) = \frac{Rd_{St}(\{V_i\})}{2-d_{St}(\{V_i\})}.
$$
establishing a bijection between birth times.

The paper then orders subsets of $X$ by increasing birth radius $(s_1,s_2,\dots,s_n)$. This ensures that $(d_{St}(s_1),\dots,d_{St}(s_n))$ are also in increasing order.

**Question:** How does the bijection between birth times result in a bijection between subcomplexes?
