My LP solver was able to solve a small ($5\times 5\times 5$) instance of OHCP. The input chain is given by the boundary of the back-face. The initial bfs found via artificial variables **was** the input chain. I only rendered iterations during stage 2 in which the objective improved ($\theta^*>0$).
