I created a more complicated input 1-chain for OHCP and the all integral intermediate BFS's no longer held. Quick remark: I initially didn't properly align the 1-chain, that gave fractional optimal solution. Correcting the 1-chain's orientation resulted in integral optimal solution.

Input (black chain):
