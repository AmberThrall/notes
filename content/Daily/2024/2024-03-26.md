For problem 3 on the computational topology homework, I'm trying to find a pair of spaces that have the same homology groups, but are not homotopy equivalent. After talking to Patrick he mentioned comparing the torus and $S^1\vee S^1\vee S^2$.

After computing their corresponding Betti numbers over $\Z_2$, I found that for both the torus and $S^1\vee S^1\vee S^2$ the homology groups are 
$$
    H_0\cong\Z_2,~H_1\cong\Z_2\oplus\Z_2,~H_2\cong\Z_2.
$$
Which just leaves proving that they are not homotopy equivalent.

Patrick thinks you can do it by looking at the homotopy groups. While we haven't covered homotopy groups in class, I feel it is worth a try. Primarily by showing that the fundamental groups $\pi_1$ are not isomorphic.

The following notes are from reading the Wikipedia page on the fundamental group: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_group.

## Fundamental Group 
Given a topological space $X$, we define a **loop based at $x_0$** to be a continuous map $\gamma:[0,1]\rightarrow x$ such that $\gamma(0)=\gamma(1)=x_0$. Then a [[Homotopy|homotopy]] between two loops $\gamma,\gamma'$ (both based at $x_0$) would be a map $H:[0,1]\times[0,1]\rightarrow X$ such that $H(r,0)=\gamma(r)$ and $H(r,1)=\gamma'(r)$ for all $r\in [0,1]$. If such a map exists, then $\gamma$ and $\gamma'$ are homotopy equivalent, denoted $\gamma\sim\gamma'$.

The fundamental group is given by the equivalence classes of loops based at $x_0$.

> $$
>   \pi_1(X,x_0) = \{\text{loops $\gamma$ based around $x_0$}\}/\sim
> $$
> where $\sim$ is homotopy equivalence.

Looking at the name fundamental *group* suggests this set is a group. We define the product of two loops $\gamma,\gamma'$ as a new loop $\gamma\cdot\gamma':[0,1]\rightarrow X$ given by
$$
    (\gamma\cdot\gamma')(t) = \begin{cases}
        \gamma(2t) & 0\le t\le1/2 \\
        \gamma'(2t-1) & 1/2\le t\le 1.
    \end{cases}
$$
In other words, we follow loop $\gamma$ twice as fast then follow $\gamma'$ twice as fast. Thus, the fundamental group has product $[\gamma\cdot\gamma']$ for two equivalence classes $[\gamma],[\gamma']\in\pi_1(X,x_0)$. One may show this operator satisfies the group requirements.

### Fundamental Group of Circle

Let $x_0\in S^1$. Notice that any loop $\gamma:[0,1]\rightarrow S^1$ based at $x_0$ simply starts at $x_0$ then goes along the circle $m$ times before stopping at $x_0$.

Thus, for a loop $\gamma_m$ that revolves $m$-times and a loop $\gamma_n$ that revolves $n$-times, the product $\gamma_m\cdot\gamma_n$ revolves $(m+n)$-times. Therefore, one can see that $\pi_1(S^1,x_0)\cong\Z$.

### Fundamental Group of 2-Sphere

Let $x_0\in S^2$ and consider any loop $\gamma:[0,1]\rightarrow S^2$ based at $x_0$. Then one may show that the image of $\gamma$ is contractible. That is, $\gamma$ is homotopy equivalent to the trivial loop. Therefore, the fundamental group $\pi_1(S^2,x_0)$ is trivial.

### Fundamental Group of Products and Coproducts

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a continuous map between topological spaces. Let $x_0\in X$ and $y_0=f(x_0)$. If we take any loop $\gamma$ with base point $x_0$ in $X$, we can compose with $f$ to get a loop $f\circ\gamma$ with base point $y_0$ in $Y$. One may show that this induces a homomorphism
$$
    f_*:\pi_1(X,x_0)\rightarrow\pi_1(Y,y_0)
$$
between fundamental groups.

This pattern gives a rise to the **fundamental group functor** $(X,x_0)\mapsto\pi_1(X,x_0)$.

One consequence of this is that two homotopy equivalent path-connected spaces have isomorphic fundamental groups. Or more importantly for solving problem 3, two spaces with different fundamental groups are *not* homotopy equivalent.

The fundamental group functor can be shown to map products to products and coproducts to coproducts. Therefore, if $X$ and $Y$ are path connected, then 
$$
    \pi_1(X\times Y,(x_0,y_0))\cong\pi_1(X,x_0)\times\pi_1(Y,y_0)
$$
and if they are locally contractible on top of that,
$$
    \pi_1(X\vee Y)\cong \pi_1(X)*\pi_1(Y)
$$
where $*$ represents the [[Free Group|free product of groups]].

### Solving Problem 3

Given the above, the torus $T^2=S^1\times S^1$ has fundamental group $\Z\times\Z$ and the wedge sum $S^1\vee S^1\vee S^2$ has fundamental group $\Z*\Z$. If we look at the representations, we see that 
$$
    \Z\times\Z=\langle a,b\mid ab=ba\rangle~\text{ and }~\Z*\Z=\langle a,b\rangle
$$
which are not isomorphic.
