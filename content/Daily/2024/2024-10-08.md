The non $q$-tame example constructed on [[2024-10-07]] is not quite right. The following is a better constructed example:

The data points are given by $X=\bigcup_{i=1}^6 X_i$ where
$$
\begin{align*}
	X_1 &= \{(22,75+10k)\mid k\in\Z\} \\
	X_2 &= \{(24.5,72+15k)\mid k\in\Z\}\cup\{(24.5,68+15k)\mid k\in\Z\} \\
	X_3 &= \{(27,75+10k)\mid k\in\Z\} \\
	X_4 &= \{(32,75+10k)\mid k\in\Z\} \\
	X_5 &= \{(34.5,72+15k)\mid k\in\Z\}\cup\{(34.5,68+15k)\mid k\in\Z\} \\
	X_6 &= \{(37,75+10k)\mid k\in\Z\}
\end{align*}
$$
We use a filter of $f:X\rightarrow\R$ given by $(x,y)\mapsto y$. We cover the real-line with cover elements $\cal{U}=\{U_k\}_{k\in\Z}\cup\{V_k\}_{k\in\Z}$ where
$$
\begin{align*}
	U_k &= (64+10k,76+10k) \\
	V_k &= (71+15k,88+15k)
\end{align*}
$$
The resulting refined pullback consists of $6\times 11$ boxes $U_k'$ and $11\times12$ boxes $V_k'$. Each $U_k'$ and $V_k'$ overlap to form a $2.5\times3$ box. So their Steinhaus distance is 
$$
\begin{align*}
	d_{St}(U_k,V_k) &= 1 - \frac{\mu(U_k\cap V_k)}{\mu(U_k\cup V_k)} \\
	&= 1 - \frac{6.5}{190.5} \\
	&= \frac{368}{381}.
\end{align*}
$$
So in the filtration, all edges are born at time $368/381$. Define the cycle $\gamma_k$ that loops around diamond $k$. Then the set $\{\gamma_k\}_{k\in\Z}$ forms a linearly independent set, i.e., the first homology group has infinite dimension. Therefore, the map between the first homology group at $\alpha=367/381$ and at $\alpha=368/381$ has infinite rank, i.e., it is not $q$-tame.
