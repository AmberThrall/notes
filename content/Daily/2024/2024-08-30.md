# Persistence Modules

> [!def] Persistence Module
> Given a poset $T\subseteq\R$, a **$T$-persistence module** $\bb{V}$ is an indexed family of vector spaces (over some field $k$) $(V_t)_{t\in T}$ with a family of linear maps $(v_s^t:V_s\rightarrow V_t\mid s\le t)$ such that $v_s^t\circ v_t^r = v_s^t$ for all $s\le t\le r$ and $v_s^s=1_{V_s}$.

We typically visualize persistence modules as a chain of vector spaces:
$$
	V_{t_1} \rightarrow V_{t_2} \rightarrow V_{t_3} \rightarrow\cdots
$$
Given two $T$-persistence modules $\bb{U}$ and $\bb{V}$, we can construct a persistence module **homomorphism** between $\bb{U}$ and $\bb{V}$ to be a collection of linear maps
$$
	\Phi = (\phi_t: U_t\rightarrow V_t\mid t\in T)
$$
such that the linear maps are preserved, i.e., the diagram below commutes for all $s\le t$.

![[SS_2024-06-11_1718142701.png#invert | center ]]

Under such a homomorphism, persistence modules form a category. We denote the homset by $\Hom(\bb{U},\bb{V})$.

A particularly useful persistence module is the **interval module**. Given posets $J\subseteq T\subseteq\R$ where $J$ is an interval, we define the $T$-persistence module $\bb{I}_T^J$ with spaces
$$
	I_t = \begin{cases}
		k & \text{if }t\in J \\
		0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
$$
and maps
$$
	i_s^t = \begin{cases}
		1_k & \text{if }s,t\in J \\
		0 & \text{otherwise.}
	\end{cases}
$$
For example, if $a<b<c$ the $\{a,b,c\}$-interval module $\bb{I}[a,b]$ is 
$$
	k \xrightarrow{1} k\xrightarrow{0} 0.
$$
Interval modules represent features that are present over an interval $J$ that are absent elsewhere. For example, in simplicial complex filtrations, the homology groups decompose into a direct sum of interval modules. Each interval module represents a class of cycles that are alive only in the interval $J$.

We can compose two or more persistence modules with the direct sum.

> [!def] Direct Sum of Persistence Modules
> Given two $T$-persistence modules $\bb{U},\bb{V}$, the **direct sum** $\bb{W}=\bb{U}\oplus\bb{V}$ is the $T$-persistence module with spaces

> $$
> and linear maps
> $$
> 	(w_s^t:u_s^t\oplus v_s^t\mid s\le t).
> $$

We often do this the opposite direction. Given a persistence module $\bb{V}$, we want to find interval modules $(\bb{I}^{J_\ell})_{\ell\in L}$ such that
$$
	\bb{V} = \bigoplus_{\ell\in L}\bb{I}^{J_\ell}.
$$
We call such a persistence module **decomposable**. Note that interval modules are indecomposable because the projection map $(u,v)\mapsto (u,0)$ is either trivial or an isomorphism, i.e., an interval module can only decompose as $\bb{I}=\bb{I}\oplus 0$ or $\bb{I}=0\oplus\bb{I}$.

# Persistence Diagrams

We often want to visualize the structure of persistence modules. For example, assume we have a persistence module composed of sublevelsets of a function $f:X\rightarrow\R$,
$$
	\bb{X}_\text{sub}^f:X^{t_1}\rightarrow X^{t_2}\rightarrow X^{t_3}\rightarrow\cdots
$$
where the maps are given by inclusion $X^{t_i}\hookrightarrow X^{t_j}$ when $i\le j$. If we apply the $p$-dimensional singular homology functor, we get a new persistence module of singular homology groups
$$
	H_p(\bb{X}_\text{sub}^f): H_p(X^{t_1})\rightarrow H_p(X^{t_2})\rightarrow H_p(X^{t_3})\rightarrow\cdots.
$$
One may show that each index $t_i$ corresponds to a critical point in the space $X$. So by plotting a point $(i,j)$ in the extended half-plane $\overline{\cal{H}}$ if a cycle is born at $t_i$ and dies at $t_j$, we get what is known as a **persistence diagram**. For example, 

![[SS_2024-06-12_1718226331.png#invert | center ]]

The above figure is an example of a **decorated persistence diagram** where the points are given a tick direction. In an **undecorated persistence diagram** the points are not given a tick direction. Note that we have two points at infinity. This implies that there is a 0-cycle born at time $a$ that never dies. Likewise there is a 1-cycle born at time $f$ that never dies.

**Question:** What exactly do the tick directions represent?

For persistence modules over a poset $T\subseteq\R$, it is important to distinguish the topology of the intervals (open, closed, half-open). We do so with **decorated real numbers**. Given that $p\le q$ we have the following four cases:
$$
\begin{align*}
	(p^-,q^-)\text{ means } [p,q) \\
	(p^-,q^+)\text{ means } [p,q] \\
	(p^+,q^-)\text{ means } (p,q) \\
	(p^+,q^+)\text{ means } (p,q]
\end{align*}
$$
If the decoration is unknown (or we do not wish to specify), then we use the notation $(p^*,q^*)$ and any of the four options above are possibilities.

Assume that $\bb{V}$ is a decomposable persistence module over $T\subseteq \R$, i.e., 
$$
	\bb{V} = \bigoplus_{\ell\in L}\bb{I}(p_\ell^*,q_\ell^*).
$$
Then we define the **decorated persistence diagram** of $\bb{V}$ to be the multiset
$$
	\text{Dgm}(\bb{V}) = \{(p^*,q^*)\mid \ell\in L\}
$$
and the **undecorated persistence diagram** of $\bb{V}$ to be the multiset
$$
	\textup{dgm}(\bb{V}) = \{(p,q)\mid\ell\in L\} \setminus \Delta
$$
where $\Delta=\{(x,x)\in\overline{\cal{H}}\}$ is the diagonal in the extended half-plane.

Since the decomposition of persistence modules is unique up to order, these definitions are well-defined. In decorated persistence diagrams, the tick direction is drawn depending on the decoration of the interval. The possible tick directions are

![[SS_2024-06-26_1719439191.png#invert | center]]

## Rectangle Measures

Let $\cal{D}\subset \R^2$. Define
$$
	\textup{Rect}(\cal{D}) = \{[a,b]\times[c,d]\subset\cal{D}\mid a<b,c<d\},
$$
i.e., the set of closed rectangles contained in $\cal{D}$. A **rectangle measure** or $r$-**measure** on $\cal{D}$ is a function $\mu:\textup{Rect}(\cal{D})\rightarrow\{0,1,2,\dots\}\cup\{\infty\}$ such that whenever $a<p<b\le c<q<d$ we get that
$$
\begin{align*}
	\mu([a,b]\times[c,d]) &= \mu_\bb{V}([a,p]\times[c,d]) + \mu_\bb{V}([p,b]\times[c,d]) \\
	\mu([a,b]\times[c,d]) &= \mu_\bb{V}([a,b]\times[c,q]) + \mu_\bb{V}([a,b]\times[q,d]).
\end{align*}
$$
In other words, the function is additive with respect to horizontal and vertical splitting.

![[Screenshot from 2024-07-15 15-19-11.png#invert | center]]

We define the **interior** of $\cal{D}$ to be
$$
	\cal{D}^\circ = \{(p,q)\mid\exists R\in\textup{Rect}(\cal{D})~\text{s.t.}~(p,q)\in R^\circ\}
$$
where $R^\circ$ is the interior of the rectangle $R$. In other words, the set of points in $\cal{D}$ such that there is an open rectangle contained inside $\cal{D}$ that contains said point. 

For decorated points we use the $r$-interior
$$
	\cal{D}^\blacksquare=\{(p^*,q^*)\mid \exists R\in\text{Rect}(\cal{D})~\text{s.t.}~(p^*,q^*)\in R\}.
$$
which behaves the same as the interior but we use the closed rectangle and  require the tick to lie inside the rectangle as well.

> [!thm] Equivalence Theorem
> Let $\cal{D}\subseteq\R^2$. There is a bijective correspondence between 
> - Finite $r$-measures on $\cal{D}$
> - Locally finite multisets $A$ in $\cal{D}^\blacksquare$
> 
> The measure $\mu$ corresponding to the multiset $A$ is related by the formula

> $$
> where $m:A\rightarrow\{0,1,2,\dots\}$ is the multiplicity function, for all rectangles $R\in\textup{Rect}(\cal{D})$.

Therefore, one may view a finite $r$-measure of a rectangle $R$ as simply counting the number of points in $A$ that lie inside $R$.

One may extend the equivalence theorem to non-finite $r$-measures by restricting the $r$-interior $\cal{D}^\blacksquare$ to only rectangles of finite size
$$
\begin{align*}
	\cal{F}^\circ(\mu) &= \{(p,q)\mid \exists R\in\cal{D}^\circ\text{ such that }\mu(R)<\infty\} \\
	\cal{F}^\blacksquare(\mu) &= \{(p^*,q^*)\mid\exists R\in\cal{D}^\blacksquare\text{ such that }\mu(R)<\infty\}.
\end{align*}
$$
and using horizontal or vertical splitting.

We define the **decorated diagram** of an $r$-measure $\mu$ to be the unique multiset $\textup{Dgm}(\mu)$ that satisfies
$$
	\mu(R) = \textup{card}(\textup{Dgm}(\mu)|_R)
$$
as described in the equivalence theorem. The **undecorated diagram** of $\mu$ then ignores the ticks and restricts to the interior, i.e.,  
$$
	\textup{dgm}(\mu) = \{(p,q)\mid(p^*,q^*)\in\textup{Dgm}(\mu)\}\cap\cal{F}^\circ(\mu).
$$

## The Persistence Measure

Let $\bb{V}$ be a $T$-persistence module where $T$ is a finite subset of $\R$, i.e.,
$$
	\bb{V}: V_{t_1}\rightarrow V_{t_2} \rightarrow\cdots\rightarrow V_{t_n}.
$$
We can represent this module as a **quiver**
$$
	\bullet\textemdash\bullet\textemdash\cdots\textemdash\bullet
$$
where a filled circle $\bullet$ indicates where the module has non-zero rank and the unfilled circle $\circ$ indicate where the module has rank 0. For example if $a<b<c$, the six possible interval modules over $\{a,b,c\}$ are
$$
\begin{align*}
	\bb{I}[a,a] &= \bullet_a\textemdash\circ_b\textemdash\circ_c & \bb{I}[a,b] &= \bullet_a\textemdash\bullet_b\textemdash\circ_c & \bb{I}[a,c] &= \bullet_a\textemdash\bullet_b\textemdash\bullet_c \\
	\bb{I}[b,b] &= \circ_a\textemdash\bullet_b\textemdash\circ_c & \bb{I}[b,c] &= \circ_a\textemdash\bullet_b\textemdash\bullet_c \\
	\bb{I}[c,c] &= \circ_a\textemdash\circ_b\textemdash\bullet_c
\end{align*}
$$

We write 
$$
	\langle[a_i,a_j]\mid\bb{V}\rangle\text{ or }\langle\cdots\textemdash\bullet_{a_i}\textemdash\cdots\textemdash\bullet_{a_j}\textemdash\cdots\mid\bb{V}\rangle
$$
to indicate the number of copies of $\bb{I}[a_i,a_j]$ in the interval decomposition of $\bb{V}$.

For a persistence module $\bb{V}$, we define the **persistence measure** of $\bb{V}$ to be the $r$-measure
$$
	\mu_\bb{V}(R) = \langle\circ_a\textemdash\bullet_b\textemdash\bullet_c\textemdash\circ_d\mid\bb{V}\rangle
$$
for rectangles $R=[a,b]\times[c,d]$ with $a<b\le c<d$. It was shown by Gunnar Carlsson and Vin de Silva that
$$
	\mu_\bb{V}(R) = \textup{dim}\left[\frac{\textup{Im}(v_b^c)\cap\textup{Ker}(v_c^d)}{\textup{Im}(v_a^c)\cap\Ker(v_c^d)}\right]
$$
where $R=[a,b]\times[c,d]$. Moreover, if the spaces $V_a,V_b,V_c,V_d$ are finite-dimensional (or at least $r_b^c<\infty$), then
$$
	\mu_\bb{V}(R) = r_b^c-r_a^c-r_b^d+r_a^d
$$
where $r_s^t=\textup{rank}(v_s^t:V_s\rightarrow V_t)$.

For a decomposable persistence module over $\R$, one may show that the persistence measure corresponds to the decorated diagram as in the equivalence theorem, i.e.,
$$
	\mu_\bb{V}(R) = \textup{card}(\textup{Dgm}(\bb{V})|_R).
$$

Hence, one may say that
$$
	\textup{Dgm}(\bb{V}) = \textup{Dgm}(\mu_\bb{V}).
$$

# Tameness

We say a persistence module $\bb{V}$ is **finite** if it is a finite direct sum of interval modules. We say it is **locally finite** if and only if 
1. each $V_t$ is finite-dimensional
2. there is a locally finite set $S\subset\R$ such that $v_b^c:V_b\rightarrow V_c$ is an isomorphism for every pair $b<c$ with $[b,c]\cap S=\emptyset$.



![[Screenshot from 2024-07-26 14-26-11.png#invert | center]]

There are four notions of tameness.

1. We say $\bb{V}$ is **$q$-tame** if $\mu_\bb{V}(Q)<\infty$ for every quadrant $Q$ not touching the diagonal, i.e., for all $b<c$
$$
	\textup{rank}(V_b\rightarrow V_c) = \langle\bullet_b\textemdash\bullet_c\mid\bb{V}\rangle<\infty.
$$

2. We say $\bb{V}$ is **$h$-tame** if $\mu_\bb{V}(H)<\infty$ for every horizontally infinite strip $H$ not touching the diagonal, i.e., for all $b<c<d$
$$
	\langle\bullet_b\textemdash\bullet_c\textemdash\circ_d\mid\bb{V}\rangle<\infty	
$$

3. We say $\bb{V}$ is **$v$-tame** if $\mu_\bb{V}(V)<\infty$ for every vertically infinite strip $V$ not touching the diagonal, i.e., for all $a<b<c$
$$
	\langle\circ_a\textemdash\bullet_b\textemdash\bullet_c\mid\bb{V}\rangle<\infty
$$

4. We say that $\bb{V}$ is **$r$-tame** if $\mu_\bb{V}(R)<\infty$ for every finite rectangle $R$ not touching the diagonal, i.e., for all $a<b<c<d$
$$
	\langle\circ_a\textemdash\bullet_b\textemdash\bullet_c\textemdash\circ_d\mid\bb{V}\rangle < \infty
$$

The tameness conditions have the following inclusion diagram:

![[Screenshot from 2024-07-26 14-35-33.png#invert | center]]

We will be particularly interested in $q$-tame modules.

# Interleaving

We say that two persistence modules $\bb{U},\bb{V}$ are isomorphic if there are homomorphisms 
$$
	\Phi\in\Hom(\bb{U},\bb{V}), \Psi\in\Hom(\bb{V},\bb{U})
$$
such that 
$$
	\Psi\Phi = 1_\bb{U}\text{ and }\Phi\Psi = 1_\bb{V}.
$$
That is the diagram

![[Screenshot from 2024-07-26 14-42-59.png#invert | center | 300]]

commutes for all indices $a\le b$.

Such a relation in practice is too strong. Instead we use a weaker relation that allows a level of uncertainty. Let $\bb{U},\bb{V}$ be persistence modules over $T\subset\R$ and $\delta\ge0$. A **homomorphism of degree $\delta$** is a collection of linear maps
$$
	\Phi = (\phi_t:U_t\rightarrow V_{t+\delta}\mid t\in T)
$$
such that the diagram

![[Screenshot from 2024-07-26 14-47-34.png#invert | center]]

commutes for all $a\le b$. The set of all homomorphisms of degree $\delta$ between $\bb{U}$ and $\bb{V}$ is denoted by $\Hom^\delta(\bb{U},\bb{V})$. Note that the composition of a homomorphism of degree $\delta_1$ and a homomorphism of degree $\delta_2$ gives a homomorphism of degree $\delta_1+\delta_2$.

For $\delta\ge0$ the simplest homomorphism of degree $\delta$ is called the **shift map**, $1_\bb{V}^\delta\in\Hom^\delta(\bb{V},\bb{V})$, which is given by the maps
$$
	1_\bb{V}^\delta = (v_t^{t+\delta}:V_t\rightarrow V_{t+\delta}\mid t\in T)
$$
from the underlying persistence diagram structure.

We say that two persistence modules $\bb{U},\bb{V}$ are **$\delta$-interleaved** if there are two homomorphisms
$$
	\Phi\in\Hom^\delta(\bb{U},\bb{V}),~\Psi\in\Hom^\delta(\bb{V},\bb{U})
$$
such that 
$$
	\Psi\Phi = 1_\bb{U}^{2\delta},~\Phi\Psi = 1_\bb{V}^{2\delta}.
$$
In other words, for all $a\le b$ the four diagrams below commute:

![[Screenshot from 2024-07-26 15-22-51.png#invert | center]]

Given two $\delta$-interleaved persistence modules, we can continuously interpolate between the two.

> [!lemma] Interpolation Lemma
> Suppose $\bb{U},\bb{V}$ are a $\delta$-interleaved pair of persistence modules. Then there exists a 1-parameter family of persistence modules $(\bb{W}_x\mid x\in[0,\delta])$ such that $\bb{W}_0,\bb{W}_\delta$ are equal to $\bb{U},\bb{V}$ respectively, and $\bb{W}_x,\bb{W}_y$ are $|y-x|$-interleaved.

More specifically, if $\Phi\in\Hom^\delta(\bb{U},\bb{V})$ and $\Psi\in\Hom^\delta(\bb{V},\bb{U})$ are the interleaving maps, then for each $x<y$ in $[0,\delta]$ we get a pair of interleaving maps
$$
	\Phi_x^y\in\Hom^{y-x}(\bb{W}_x,\bb{W}_y), \Psi_y^x\in\Hom^{y-x}(\bb{W}_y,\bb{W}_x)
$$
such that $\Phi_0^\delta=\Phi$, $\Psi_\delta^0=\Psi$ and 
$$
	\Phi_x^y = \Phi_z^y\Phi_x^z~\text{ and }~\Psi_y^x = \Psi_z^x\Psi_y^z
$$
for all $x<z<y$. That is, we get a persistence module over $\R^2$.

Let $\bb{U},\bb{V}$ be persistence modules. We define the **interleaving distance** of $\bb{U}$ and $\bb{V}$ to be 
$$
\begin{align*}
	d_i(\bb{U},\bb{V}) &= \inf\{\delta\mid\text{$\bb{U}$ and $\bb{V}$ are $\delta$-interleaved}\} \\
	&= \min\{\delta\mid\text{$\bb{U}$ and $\bb{V}$ are $(\delta+\epsilon)$-interleaved for all $\epsilon>0$}\}.
\end{align*}
$$
If no such $\delta$-interleaving exists, we say that $d_i(\bb{U},\bb{V})=+\infty$.

The interleaving distance forms a pseudometric. It is symmetric and it satisfies the triangle inequality. However, there are non-isomorphic modules with an interleaving distance of zero.

# The Bottleneck Distance

The bottleneck distance between two persistence modules is measured using their persistence diagrams. That is, given persistence modules $\bb{U}$ and $\bb{V}$, the bottleneck distance looks at all possible pairings in $\textup{dgm}(\bb{U})$ and $\text{dgm}(\bb{V})$ and finds their distance. For unmatched pairs, we take half the distance from the diagonal.

We define a **partial matching** between multisets $A$ and $B$ to be a collection $M\subset A\times B$ of ordered pairs such that
1. For every $\alpha\in A$ there is at most one $\beta\in B$ such that $(\alpha,\beta)\in M$.
2. For every $\beta\in B$ there is at most one $\alpha\in A$ such that $(\alpha,\beta)\in M$.

Given a partial matching $M$, we say that it is a **$\delta$-matching** if 
1. If $(\alpha,\beta)\in M$, then $d^\infty(\alpha,\beta)\le\delta$
2. If $\alpha\in A$ is unmatched, then $d^\infty(\alpha,\Delta)\le\delta$
3. If $\beta\in B$ is unmatched, then $d^\infty(\beta,\Delta)\le\delta$.

Here we are using the $\ell^\infty$ metric on $\R^2$,
$$
	d^\infty((p,q),(r,s)) = \max(|p-r|,|q-s|).
$$
In the case that one or more of the points are at infinity, we use the following distances:
$$
\begin{align*}
	d^\infty((-\infty,q),(-\infty,s)) &= |q-s| \\
	d^\infty((p,\infty),(r,\infty)) &= |p-r| \\
	d^\infty((-\infty,\infty),(-\infty,\infty)) &= 0 \\
	d^\infty((p,q),(-\infty,s)) = \infty \\
	d^\infty((p,q),(r,\infty)) = \infty
\end{align*}
$$
For the unmatched points, we take half the $\ell^\infty$ distance down to the diagonal. That is,
$$
	d^\infty((p,q),\Delta) = \frac{1}{2}(q-p).
$$
The **bottleneck distance** is then taken to be the smallest possible $\delta$-matching, i.e., given multisets $A$ and $B$,
$$
	d_b(A,B) = \inf\{\delta\mid\text{there is a $\delta$-matching between $A$ and $B$}\}.
$$
 
Like the interleaving distance, the bottleneck distance satisfies the triangle inequality.
# The Isometry Theorem

In the case that $\bb{U}$ and $\bb{V}$ are $q$-tame, the interleaving and bottleneck distances correspond.

> [!thm] Isometry Theorem
> If $\bb{U},\bb{V}$ are $q$-tame persistence modules, then
> $$
> 	d_i(\bb{U},\bb{V}) = d_b(\textup{dgm}(\bb{U}),\textup{dgm}(\bb{V})).
> $$

This theorem is the combination of two parts: the *stability theorem*
$$
	d_i(\bb{U},\bb{V}) \ge d_b(\textup{dgm}(\bb{U}),\textup{dgm}(\bb{V}))
$$
and the *converse stability theorem*
$$
	d_i(\bb{U},\bb{V}) \le d_b(\textup{dgm}(\bb{U}),\textup{dgm}(\bb{V})).
$$
