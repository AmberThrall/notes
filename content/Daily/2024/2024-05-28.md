# Data Exploration for Paragonimiasis

Raw data is stored in `CLEAN-ActiveSurvey.xlsx`.

**File:** `DataExploration.ipynb`
- Primary goal is to familiarize myself with the Python package `pandas`.
- Data set contains 9,355 rows and 42 columns
- 9 of the columns are demographic data (age, address, sex, etc.)
- The average age per village in the data set appears bimodal. Around half the villages have a mean age of around 13, whereas the other half have a mean age around 50.
- There are 10 symptoms, each symptom takes two columns (has symptom and duration of symptom)
- If the patient answered no to a symptom, the corresponding duration is set to NaN.
- Duration of fever is missing for 94% of patients with a fever.
- Breakdown of symptoms and NaN entries:

| Symptom | Presence % | Missing Duration % |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Cough   | 5.954%     | 0%            |
| Expectoration | 2.2127% | 1.4493% | 
| Chest Pain | 2.6296% | 0% |
| Fever | 99.4976% | 94.0052% | 
| Loss of Appetite | 1.5714% | 4.0816% |
| Blood in Sputum | 0.1924% | 0% |
| Night Sweats | 2.0844% | 3.0769% |
| Weight Loss | 0.6734% | 42.8571% | 
| Shortness of Breath | 2.79% | 1.494% |
| Tiredness | 5.7082% | 1.6854% |

- Column `Duration_of_the_symptom` is NaN for all but a handful of entries.
- After filling duration NaNs when no presence of symptom to zero and removing `Duration_of_the_symptom`, I dropped the remaining rows with an NaN entry. This resulted in a much smaller data set size of 550.
- The presence of symptoms on the smaller data set is quite different:

| Symptom | Presence % |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Cough | 85.2727% |
| Expectoration | 30.5455% |
| Chest Pain | 38.1818% | 
| Fever | 93.8182% |
| Loss of Appetite | 20.7273% |
| Blood in Sputum | 1.81812% |
| Night Sweats | 31.6364% |
| Weight Loss | 6.5455% |
| Shortness of Breath | 44.1818% |
| Tiredness | 76.1818% |

**File:** `TossFever.ipynb`

- Since the vast majority of NaN entries are for fever duration and 99% of patients had a fever, it may make sense to drop the fever columns. We also drop `Duration_of_the_symptom` since that is 99% NaN. This results in 9,209 remaining patients.
- Durations of symptoms are stored as strings typically of the form "? days" or "? weeks" (a few entries are lacking spaces). With some simple regex matching we can convert these strings to an integer representing the number of days.
- Relation to presence and duration of symptom are as follows:

| Symptom | Presence % | Count | Mean | Std | Min | Max |
| ------- | ---------- | ----- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cough | 5.5598% | 512 | 9.4 | 4.161824 | 2 | 21 |
| Expectoration | 1.8243% | 168 | 11.303571 | 4.30952 | 2 | 14 |
| Chest Pain | 2.2804% | 210 | 9.142857 | 4.828996 | 2 | 14 |
| Loss of Appetite | 1.2379% | 114 | 12.789474 | 6.323819 | 4 | 30 |
| Blood in Sputum | 0.1303% | 12 | 7.25 | 4.266679 | 4 | 14 |
| Night Sweats | 1.8895% | 174 | 5.827586 | 5.988828 | 2 | 30 |
| Weight Loss | 0.3909% | 36 | 22.25 | 22.598831 | 1 | 90 |
| Shortness of Breath | 2.6387% | 243 | 6.481481 | 4.465046 | 2 | 14 |
| Tiredness | 4.8431% | 446 | 8.026906 | 4.321797 | 2 | 30 |

 - Only three patients have been treated for TB
