We seek a counter example that shows that the Steinhaus filtration is not always $q$-tame.

Construct the following data set
$$
	X = \{0,1\}\times\N.
$$
Our lens $f:X\rightarrow\R$ we define by $(n,x)\mapsto n$, i.e., project onto $\N$. Cover the projection with the cover elements
$$
	\{\left(n-1,n+1\right)\mid n\in\N\}.
$$
Thus under the MAPPER our cover is then
$$
	\cal{U} = \{B_{1}(x,n)\mid (x,n)\in X\}.
$$

Consider two adjacent balls $U_1$ and $U_2$, then
$$
	d_{St}(U_1, U_2) = 1-\frac{\mu(U_1\cap U_2)}{\mu(U_1\cup U_2)}.
$$
According to https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/402858/area-of-intersection-between-two-circles the area of the intersection is 
$$
	\mu(U_1\cap U_2) = 1^2\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{6\pi-3\sqrt{3}}{6}.
$$
So the Steinhaus distance between two balls is
$$
	1 - \frac{6\pi-3\sqrt{3}}{6\pi + 3\sqrt{3}} \approx 0.432.
$$

We now consider three adjacent balls $U_1,U_2$ and $U_3$. According to https://www.benfrederickson.com/calculating-the-intersection-of-3-or-more-circles/,
$$
	\mu(U_1\cap U_2\cap U_3) \approx 0.44297.
$$
So
$$
	\mu(U_1\cup U_2\cup U_3) = 3\pi1^2 - \mu(U_1\cap U_2) - \mu(U_2\cap U_3) = \frac{3\pi+3\sqrt{3}}{3}.
$$
Thus, the Steinhaus distance between three balls is approximately
$$
	1 - \frac{3\cdot0.432}{3\pi+3\sqrt{3}} \approx 0.911.
$$

In other words, in our Steinhaus filtration triangles are not born until about $\alpha\approx0.911$.


Notice that for all $t\in\N$, the edge $e_t=[(0,t),(1,t)]$ is in $\textup{Nrv}_{St}(\cal{U},0.432)$ but it is not on the boundary of a triangle. Define the cycle
$$
	\gamma_t = \sum_{i=1}^t[(0,i-1),(0,i)] + [(0,t),(1,t)] - \sum_{i=1}^t[(1,i-1),(1,i)] - [(0,0),(1,0)].
$$
The cycles $\{\gamma_t\}_{t\in\N}$ forms a linearly independent set; thus, the first homology group has infinite dimension. But for $\alpha<0.432$, the first homology group of $\textup{Nrv}_{St}(\cal{U},\alpha)$ is trivial. Therefore, there is at least one map in the persistence module that has infinite rank, i.e., it is not $q$-tame.
