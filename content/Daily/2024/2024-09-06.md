# Introduction

Given a data set on a metric space $(Y,d_Y)$ that approximates a metric space $(X,d_X)$, we want to construct a simplicial complex on $Y$ such that $X$ and $Y$ have the same homology or homotopy type. In most applications, $Y$ is finite.

One common approach is to use Vietoris-Rips complex:
$$
	\sigma=[x_0,x_1,\dots,x_k]\in\textup{Rips}(X,\alpha)\Leftrightarrow d(x_i,x_j)\le\alpha,\forall i,j=0,1,\dots,k.
$$
For a closed Riemannian manifold $X$, the geometric realization of the Vietoris-Rips complex $\textup{Rips}(Y,\alpha)$ that approximates $X$ is homotopy equivalent for sufficiently small $\alpha$. That is, if the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between $X$ and $Y$ is sufficiently small, then there is some $\alpha$ such that $\textup{Rips}(Y,\alpha)$ is homotopy equivalent to $X$.

Finding the correct radius $\alpha$ can be difficult in practice. To simplify things we often take the persistence module
$$
	\textup{$\R$ips}(X) = (\textup{Rips}(X,\alpha))_{\alpha\in\R}.
$$
It was shown by Chazal et. al. that if $X$ and $Y$ are finite metric spaces, then 
$$
	d_b(\textup{dgm}(\text{$\R$ips(X)}),\textup{dgm}(\text{$\R$ips}(Y))) \le 2d_{GH}(X,Y)
$$
where $d_b$ is the bottleneck distance and $d_{GH}$ is the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. This result is beneficial as the bottleneck distance is computationally simpler than the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. Thus, we seek upper bounds on the bottleneck distance.

# Gromov-Hausdorff Distance

Let $A$ be a closed subset of a metric space $(X,d)$. For $r>0$ we define the **$r$-thickening** of $A$ to be given by
$$
	A^{(r)} = \bigcup_{x\in A}B(x,r)
$$
where $B(x,r)$ is the ball centered at $x$ with radius $r$. We define the **Hausdorff distance** by
$$
	d_H(A,B) = \inf\{r>0:B\subset A^{(r)}\text{ and }A\subset B^{(r)}\}.
$$
One may view the Hausdroff distance as the farthest distance from any point of $B$ from $A$, or the farthest distance any point of $A$ from $B$ (take the larger of the two). This distance forms a metric on the set of closed sets in $X$.

The Gromov-Hausdorff distance makes use of the Hausdorff distance to measure the distance between two metric spaces. That is, given two closed metric spaces $A$ and $B$ both inside a larger metric space $X$, the **Gromov-Hausdorff distance** is given by
$$
	d_{GH}(A,B) = \inf_{f,g}d_H(f_{A\rightarrow X}(A),f_{B\rightarrow X}(B))
$$
where $f_{A\rightarrow X}$ denotes an isometric embedding of $A$ into $X$. We take the infimum over all possible embeddings. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance gives us a measure on how close two metric spaces are from being isometric. As a result, the set of all isometry classes of a metric space is itself a metric space.

One may show that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is equivalent to the **Gromov-Hausdorff approximation** which is given by
$$
	\widehat{d_{GH}}(X,Y) = \inf_{f}\{\epsilon>0:|d_Y(f(x_1),f(x_2))-d_X(x_1,x_2))|<\epsilon,\forall x_1,x_2\in X\}.
$$

# Îµ-simplicial Multi-valued Maps

We extend the notion of maps to allow for multiple outputs. That is, we define a **multi-valued map** $C:X\rightrightarrows Y$ to be a subset of $X\times Y$ such that for all $x\in X$, there is some $y\in Y$ such that $(x,y)\in C$, i.e., the projection $(x,y)\mapsto x$ is surjective.

Given two multi-valued maps $C:X\rightrightarrows Y$ and $D:Y\rightrightarrows Z$, we can compose the two to get a new multi-valued map $D\circ C:X\rightrightarrows Z$ where  $(x,z)\in D\circ C$ if and only if there is some $y\in Y$ such that $(x,y)\in C$ and $(y,z)\in D$.

We say that a single-valued map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is **subordinate** to a multi-valued map $C:X\rightrightarrows Y$, denoted $f:X\xrightarrow{C}Y$. if $f(x)\in C(x)$ for all $x\in X$.

Let $\bb{S}$ and $\bb{T}$ be filtered simplicial complexes with vertex sets $X$ and $Y$. We say that a multi-valued map $C:X\rightrightarrows Y$ is **$\epsilon$-simplicial** if for any $\alpha\in\R$ and any simplex $\sigma\in S_\alpha$ it follows that every finite subset of the image $C(\sigma)$ is a simplex of $T_{\alpha+\epsilon}$.

**Example:** Consider the filtered simplicial complex $\bb{S}:S_1\rightarrow S_2\rightarrow S_3$ where each complex $S_k$ is the standard $k$-simplex. Consider then the multi-valued map given below:

![[Screenshot from 2024-09-06 13-23-43.png#invert | center]]

$$
	C = \{(v_0,v_0'),(v_1,v_1'),(v_2,v_2'),(v_2,v_3')\}.
$$

Notice that every simplex $\sigma$ in $S_k$, the subsets of $C(\sigma)$ are simplices in $S_{k+1}$. Therefore, this multi-valued map is 1-simplicial.

$\epsilon$-simplicial maps induce a homomorphism of degree $\epsilon$ between persistence diagram.

> [!prp]
> Given two filtered simplicial complexes $\bb{S},\bb{T}$ with vertex sets $X,Y$ and a $\epsilon$-simplicial map $C:X\rightrightarrows Y$ then $C$ induces the map $H(C)\in\textup{Hom}^\epsilon(H(\bb{S}),H(\bb{T}))$ that is given by $H(f)$ for any $f:X\xrightarrow{C}Y$. 

Here $H(\bb{S})$ is the persistence module we get by applying the simplicial homology functor $S\mapsto H(S)$ to $\bb{S}$.

# Correspondences

Given a multi-valued map $C:X\rightrightarrows Y$, we say that $C$ is a correspondence if every $y\in Y$ has at least one $x\in X$ such that $(x,y)\in C$, i.e., the projection $(x,y)\mapsto y$ is surjective. Alternatively, one may view a correspondence as a multi-valued map where the transpose $C^\top:Y\rightrightarrows X$ given by
$$
	C^\top = \{(y,x)\mid (x,y)\in C\}
$$
is also a multi-valued map.

Correspondences can be seen as a form of "weak bijection". Notice that if $C$ is a correspondence, then 
$$
	1_X = \{(x,x)\mid x\in X\}\subset C^\top\circ C\text{ and }1_Y = \{(y,y)\mid y\in Y\}\subset C\circ C^\top.
$$
Moreover if both $C$ and $C^\top$ are $\epsilon$-simplicial maps, then we get two homomorphisms of degree $\epsilon$. It turns out these two homomorphisms induce an $\epsilon$-interleaving.

> [!prp]
> Let $\bb{S},\bb{T}$ be filtered simplicial complexes with vertex sets $X$ and $Y$. If $C:X\rightrightarrows Y$ is a correspondence such that $C$ and $C^\top$ are both $\epsilon$-simplicial, then $H(C)$ and $H(C^\top)$ induce an $\epsilon$-interleaving between $H(\bb{S})$ and $H(\bb{T})$.

This result applied to $q$-tame persistence modules provides a framework for finding an upper bound on the bottleneck distance, i.e., if two filtered simplicial complexes with $q$-tame persistence modules have a correspondence $C$ between their vertex sets such that $C$ and $C^\top$ are $\epsilon$-simplicial, then
$$
	d_b(\textup{dgm}(H(\bb{S})), \textup{dgm}(H(\bb{T}))) \le \epsilon.
$$
For example, we claim that given metric spaces $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ if $\epsilon>2d_{GH}(X,Y)$ then the persistence modules $H(\R\text{ips}(X))$ and $H(\R\text{ips}(Y))$ are $\epsilon$-interleaved. To prove this, we first introduce the notion of **distortion**: given a multi-valued map $C:X\rightrightarrows Y$ between metric spaces, the distortion of $C$ is given by
$$
	\textup{dis}(C) = \sup\{|d_X(x,x')-d_Y(y,y')|:(x,y),(x',y')\in C\}.
$$
One may show that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is given by the smallest possible distortion between the two spaces:
$$
	d_{GH}(X,Y) = \frac{1}{2}\inf\{\textup{dis}(C):C:X\rightrightarrows  Y\text{ is a correspondence}\}.
$$
We may now prove the result.

> [!lemma]
> Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces. If $\epsilon>2d_{GH}(X,Y)$ then the persistence modules $H(\R\text{ips}(X))$ and $H(\R\text{ips}(Y))$ are $\epsilon$-interleaved.
> 

**Proof:** Since $\epsilon>2d_{GH}(X,Y)$ there is a correspondence $C:X\rightrightarrows Y$ with $\textup{dis}(C)\le\epsilon$. Take $\sigma\in\textup{Rips}(X)$ and a finite subset $\tau\subset C(\sigma)$. Since $\textup{dis}(C)\le\epsilon$, for any $y,y'\in\tau$ there is some $x,x'\in\sigma$ such that $y\in C(x)$, $y'\in C(x')$ and
$$
	|d_X(x,x') - d_Y(y,y')| \le \epsilon.
$$
If we use the reverse triangle inequality then we get that 
$$
	d_Y(y,y') \le d_X(x,x') + \epsilon \le \alpha+\epsilon.
$$
Therefore, $\tau\in\textup{Rips}(Y,\alpha+\epsilon)$. Thus, $C$ is $\epsilon$-simplicial. A similar argument shows that $C^\top$ is also $\epsilon$-simplicial. Therefore, the persistence modules $H(\R\text{ips}(X))$ and $H(\R\text{ips})(Y)$ are $\epsilon$-interleaved.
<p style='text-align:right'>Q.E.D.</p>

A similar argument shows this result holds for Cech complexes as well, i.e., the simplicial complex defined by
$$
	[x_0,x_1,\dots,x_k]\in\textup{Cech}(X,\alpha)\Leftrightarrow\bigcap_{i=0}^kB(x_i,\alpha)\ne\emptyset
$$
where $B(x_i,\alpha)$ is the closed ball with center $x_i$ and radius $\alpha$.

> [!lemma]
> Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces. If $\epsilon>2d_{GH}(X,Y)$ then the persistence modules $H(\bb{C}\text{ech}(X))$ and $H(\bb{C}\text{ech}(Y))$ are $\epsilon$-interleaved.

# Stability of Rips and Cech Complexes

We have seen that for sufficiently large $\epsilon$ two Rips (or two Cech) persistence modules are $\epsilon$-interleaved. We now seek a condition in which they are $q$-tame as well. In such a scenario, we are given an upper bound on their bottleneck distances.

Given a subset $F$ of a metric space $(X,d_X)$, we say that $F$ is an **$\epsilon$-sample** of $X$ if for every $x\in X$, there is some $f\in F$ such that $d_X(x,f)<\epsilon$. The metric space is **totally bounded** if it has a finite $\epsilon$-sample for every $\epsilon>0$.

![[Unit_square_totally_bounded_space.png#invert | center | 300]]

One may alternatively view $\epsilon$-samples as subsets that approximate the metric space $X$. Thus, a space is totally bounded if we can approximate $X$ with finitely many points for any level of accuracy $\epsilon>0$.

> [!lemma]
> If $(X,d_X)$ is totally bounded, then the persistence modules $H(\R\text{ips}(X))$ and $H(\bb{C}\text{ech}(X))$ are $q$-tame.

**Proof:** Let $F$ be an $\epsilon/2$-sample and construct the correspondence
$$
	C = \{(x,f)\in X\times F:d_X(x,f)<\frac{1}{2}\epsilon\},
$$
i.e., the correspondence that maps every $x\in X$ to its set of approximate values in $F$. Notice that
$$
\begin{align*}
	|d_X(x,x') - d_X(f,f')| &\le |d_X(x,x') - d_X(x,f')| + |d_X(x,f') - d_X(f,f')| \\
	&\le d_X(x',f') + d_X(x,f) \\
	&< \epsilon.
\end{align*}
$$
Thus, $2d_{GH}(X,F)<\epsilon$ which implies that there is an $\epsilon$-interleaving between $H(\R\text{ips}(X))$ and $H(\R\text{ips}(F))$. Notice that for $\epsilon=(b-a)/2$ the map $I_a^b:\textup{Rips}(X,a)\rightarrow\textup{Rips}(X,b)$ factors into 

![[SS_2024-05-29_1717014852.png#invert | center | 380 ]]

Since $F$ is finite dimensional, $H(\textup{Rips}(F,a+\epsilon))$ is finite-dimensional. Therefore, $I_a^b$ has finite rank, i.e., the persistence module is $q$-tame. The proof for the Cech complex is the same.
<p style='text-align:right'>Q.E.D.</p>

As a consequence, we get an upper bound on the bottleneck distances.

> [!thm]
> Let $X$ and $Y$ be totally bounded metric spaces. Then
> $$
> 	d_b(\textup{dgm}(H(\R\text{ips}(X))),\textup{dgm}(H(\R\text{ips}(Y)))) \le 2d_{GH}(X,Y)
> $$
> and
> $$
> d_b(\textup{dgm}(H(\bb{C}\text{ech}(X))),\textup{dgm}(H(\bb{C}\text{ech}(Y)))) \le 2d_{GH}(X,Y).
> $$

Note that there exists simplicial complexes $X$ such that $H(\R\text{ips}(X))$ is not $q$-tame. For example, define
$$
	X = \{(t,0)\in\R^2:t\in[0,1]\}\cup\{(t,1)\in\R^2:t\in[0,1]\}.
$$
Notice that for any $t\in[0,1]$ the edge $e_t=[(t,0),(t,1)]$ is in $\textup{Rips}(X,1)$ but is not on the boundary of a triangle. Thus, for each $t\in[0,1]$ the cycles
$$
	\gamma_t = [(0,0),(t,0)] + [(t,0),(t,1)] - [(0,1),(t,1)] - [(t,0),(t,1)]
$$
form a linearly independent set in $H_1(\text{Rips}(X,1))$, i.e., the first homology group corresponding to a radius of 1 has an uncountable dimension.
