# Paragonimiasis Data Merging

We want to merge the active and passive data sets into one large data set. This is fairly straightforward in `pandas` with `pd.concat`. However, some cleanup is necessary first:
- The column names in the Excel files are not all on row 1 making it harder to import into `pandas`. Some quick manual editing fixes this issue.
- The data sets have mostly the same columns, but there are a few columns unique to only one data set:
    - Address_of_the_healthcare_facility
    - Date_Checked
    - Date_Collection_Overnight_Fresh_sputum_sample_with_preservative
    - Date_Collection_Overnight_sputum_sample_with_Ethanol_Soln
    - Date_Collection_Spot_Serum_sample
    - Date_sent_to_Lab_Overnight_Fresh_sputum_sample_with_preservative
    - Date_sent_to_Lab_Overnight_sputum_sample_with_Ethanol_Soln
    - Date_sent_to_lab_Spot_serum_sample
    - Date_sent_to_lab_Spot_whole_blood_sample
    - Healthcare_facility_code
    - Name_of_the_healthcare_facility
    - Result_of_sputum_microscopy
    - Result_of_sputum_smear_microscopy
    - Tube_No_Overnight_Fresh_sputum_sample_with_preservative
    - Tube_No_Overnight_Fresh_sputum_sample_without_fixative
    - Tube_No_Overnight_sputum_sample_with_Ethanol_Soln
    - Tube_No_Spot_Serum_sample
    - Village_code
- When merging, these columns are set to NaN for the rows that don't have the column
- There is an overlap in `Serial_No` values. To correct this (and help differentiate the collection methodology) we add 1,000,000 to each serial for the passive data set.
- At this point we can finally merge the data sets with `pd.concat`.
- There are 26 columns marked for removal:
    - Date_of_the_interview
    - Tube_No_Spot_Fresh_sputum_sample_without_fixative
    - Date_Collection_Spot_Fresh_sputum_sample_without_fixative
    - Date_sent_to_Lab_Spot_Fresh_sputum_sample_without_fixative
    - Date_Collection_Overnight_Fresh_sputum_sample_without_fixative
    - Date_sent_to_Lab_Overnight_Fresh_sputum_sample_without_fixative
    - Tube_No_Spot_Fresh_sputum_sample_with_preservative
    - Date_Collection_Spot_Fresh_sputum_sample_with_preservative
    - Date_sent_to_Lab_Spot_Fresh_sputum_sample_with_preser
    - Tube_No_Spot_sputum_sample_with_Ethanol_Sol
    - Date_Collection_Spot_sputum_sample_with_Ethanol_Soln
    - Date_sent_to_Lab_Spot_sputum_sample_with_Ethanol_Soln
    - Tube_No_Overnight_Stool_sample
    - Date_Collection_of_Overnight_stool_sample
    - Date_Sent_to_lab_of_Overnight_stool_sample
    - Tube_No_Spot_Whole_Blood_sample
    - Date_Collection_Spot_whole_blood_sample
    - Scrutinize_Filled_all_questions
    - Scrutinize_Sputum_collected
    - Scrutinize_Stool_collected
    - Scrutinize_Blood_collected
    - Field_Investigator_name
    - Date_checked_Field_investigator
    - Checked_by_name
    - Checked_by
    - Designation
- Some columns instead of being blank have a string such as 'Nil'. I've located three unique (upto letter casing) strings: 'nil', 'nill', and 'nan'. These have been replaced with `np.nan` which results in a blank entry when saving.
- The final result has been saved as `Merged Data.csv`.
