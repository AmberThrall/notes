I often visualize a filtration as a map $f:K\rightarrow\R$ such that $f(\tau)\le f(\sigma)$ when $\tau\preceq\sigma$. Bala gave the following definition in class:

> [!def] Filtration
> A **filtration** of a simp. complex $K$ is a nested sequence of subcomplexes of $K$:
> $$ \emptyset=K^0\subseteq K^1\subseteq\cdots\subseteq K^m=K. $$

We can tie these two notions together by taking the preimage of $f$:
$$
    K^r = f^{-1}((-\infty,r]).
$$
Then by using the above construction for all $r\in\R$, we get a nested sequence of subcomplexes. 

**Question:** Is "birth time" of a simplex $\sigma$, the smallest filtration value $r$ such that $\sigma\in K^r$?

I can implement this in `scomplex` by finding all unique filtration values $r$ and returning all subcomplexes constructed by adding all simplicies with filtration value $\le r$. Under the assumption $f(\tau)\le f(\sigma)$ when $\tau\preceq\sigma$, we can simply do a depth-first search stopping each branch once a filtration value is greater than $r$. 

Computationally, finding the unique filtration values would be $O(n^2)$ and each subcomplex could be constructed in $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of simplicies (this is a rough approximation as the construction time decreases as the filtration value decreases). Resulting in a total of $O(n^2+mn)$ where $m$ is the number of unique filtration values. Since $m\le n$, we get $O(n^2)$, i.e., the main bottle neck appears to be determining the unique filtration values.
