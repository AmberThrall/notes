# Minimax Path Problem

The paper [[Steinhaus Filtration and Stable Paths in the Mapper]] seeks to find the path between vertices $s$ and $t$ of the 1-skeleton with minimal maximum Steinhaus distance. This is an example of a *minimax path problem*.

The minimax path between $s$ and $t$ can be found by finding a path on the minimum spanning tree.

# Minimum Spanning Tree

Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a **minimum spanning tree** is subgraph $G'=(V,E')$ that connects each vertex without any cycles and minimum possible total edge weight.

![[Minimum_spanning_tree.svg#invert | center]]

One greedy algorithm (making the locally optimal choice at each stage) to compute the minimum spanning tree of a graph is *Prim's algorithm*.

```
1: Associate each vertex v of a graph a number C[v] (cheapest cost of a connection to v) and an edge E[v] (edge providing cheapest connection). Initialize all values of C[v] to +âˆž and E[v] to a special value indicating no edge.
2: Initialize a forest F and a set Q of vertices not yet included in F.
3: while Q is nonempty:
4:    Find and remove a vertex v from Q with minimum C[V]
5:    Add v to F
6:    for each edges vw where w is in Q and the weight of vw is less than C[w]:
7:      Set C[w] to the cost of edge vw
8:      Set E[w] to point to edge vw
9:    endfor
10: endwhile
```

# Pareto Frontier

A **Pareto efficient** situation is one where no action or allocation available improves one individual better off without worsening another individual. The **Pareto frontier** is the set of Pareto efficient situations. The idea is to restrict ones attention to a set of efficient choices rather than considering all possible choices.
