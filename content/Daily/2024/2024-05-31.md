# Data Exploration for Passive Data

Raw data: `Questionnaire & lab register for PASSIVE survey lates.xlsx`

File: `PassiveData.ipynb`
- Data has 3045 rows and 170 columns
- No presence of parasite eggs in stool for all 3045 patients
- Data set has two values for ELISA test (binary positive/negative and continuous ELISA test value):

| | Positive | Negative |
|-| -------- | -------- |
| count | 74 | 2901 |
| mean | 0.625946 | 0.399461 |
| std | 0.123276 | 0.219057 |
| min | 0.5 | 0.024 |
| 25% | 0.5725 | 0.22 |
| 50% | 0.62 | 0.3 |
| 75% | 0.63 | 0.58 |
| max | 1.47 | 1.47 |

- This data set is missing significantly less symptom durations:

| Symptom | Presence % | Missing Duration % |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Cough   | 96.815496% | 0.03391%           |
| Expectoration | 80.302035% | 0.040883%    |
| Chest Pain | 81.28693% | 0%               |
| Fever   | 97.800394% | 3.356831%          |
| Loss of Appetite | 38.378201% | 0.085543% |
| Blood in Sputum | 1.181878% | 0%          |
| Night Sweats | 53.906763% | 0.121803%     |
| Weight Loss | 11.260670%  | 1.166181%     |
| Shortness of Breath | 78.233749% | 0%     |
| Tiredness   | 73.965857% | 1.065246%      |

- Removing rows missing symptom duration (when symptom is present) reduces number of patients down to 2890 (-155 patients).
- Some duration strings are malformed (e.g. 'days' doesn't specify a number of days). We removed these rows bringing it down to 2843 patients.
- Duration of symptoms:

| Symptom | Presence % | Count | Mean | Std | Min | Max |
