More progress on marching cubes approach to problem:
1. Fixed orientation
2. Generated tetrahedralization of unit cube that contains complex from marching cubes as a 2-chain

For 4D, I'm using the following isosurface:
$$
	f(x,y,z,w) = \left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}-R\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{z^2+w^2}-R\right)^2 - r^2
$$
Which looks like the following animation (animating $w$ from $-0.5$ to $0.5$):

Alternatively, we could do a 4D sphere:
$$
	f(x,y,z,w) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 - r^2
$$

Or metaballs:
$$
	f(x,y,z,w) = \sum_i\frac{r_i^2}{(x-x_i)^2+(y-y_i)^2+(z-z_i)^2 + (w-w_i)^2}-1
$$
