Mesh construction process:
1. Start with corner points of a cube.
2. Generate Delaunay tetrahedralization via tetgen.
3. Take the 2-skeleton
4. Subdivide twice

The resulting complex has a Mobius strip as a subcomplex:

The 2-dimensional boundary matrix for the above mesh is $219\times162$ in size.
It contains the $13\times 13$ submatrix
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
&  & 1 & 1 \\
& & & 1 & -1 \\ 
& & -1 & & & 1 \\ 
& & & & & 1 & 1 \\
& & & & & & 1 & -1 \\
& & & & & & & 1 & 1 \\
1 & & & & 1 \\ 
& & & & & & & & & -1 & 1 \\ 
& & & & & & & & -1 & & -1 \\ 
& & & & & & & & & 1 & & 1 \\ 
& 1 & & & & & & & & & & & 1 \\
& & & & & & & & & & & -1 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
which has absolute determinant 2. 

Therefore, the boundary matrix is not TU. As a result, we are guaranteed that the polyhedra corresponding to our LP has at least one non-integral corner point. However, upon solving the LP we still get integral solutions for free:

From Bala's paper [Optimal Homologous Cycles, Total Unimodularity, and Linear Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0338):

> [!thm]
> $[\partial_2]$ is totally unimodular if and only if the simplicial complex $K$ has no Mobius subcomplex of dimension 2.

**Goal:** Understand why this result is true; primarily the $\Leftarrow$ direction.

**Our Problem:** Under what conditions (if any) are we guaranteed integral solutions?
