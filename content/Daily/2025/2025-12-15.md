While using a cubicial complex significantly reduces the number of simplices, the marching cube algorithm is more complex than the marching tetrahedra algorithm. Each tetrahedra in marching tetrahedra correspond to 8 cases. Upto rotation, marching cubes has 15 cases. It is unclear if these cases can be built with cubes.

Below is my attempt to handle each case. I do not think these pieces connect correctly without introducing holes.

Even if they did, we also need to ensure they connect correctly in 4D.

**Potential Fix:** Make each case a valid cubicial complex with no holes. When gluing two pieces together, remove any overlapping faces. However, this may introduce unwanted voids into the surface.

# New Simpler Approach

We start with a 3D analog. Consider a cubicial complex of a 3D unit cube. Consider two parallel faces:
$$
	F_1 = \{z=0\}~\text{ and }~F_2 = \{z=1\}.
$$
Define the 1-chain $z=\varphi_1-\varphi_2$ where
$$
	\varphi_1 = \partial F_1~\text{ and }~\varphi_2 = \partial F_2.
$$
Right now, this instance gives the zero chain. Indeed, let $y=F_2-F_1$. Then
$$
	\partial y + z = (\varphi_2-\varphi_1) + (\varphi_1 - \varphi_2) = 0.
$$
However, if we add some holes this problem is avoided. That is, we add a hole going from the center of $F_1$ to the center of $F_2$.

Lets now extend to 4D. A 4-dimensional cubicial complex with 6 vertices along each axis can be represented by an $11\times11\times11\times11$ array of cells. As an example, below is a 2D example with 5 vertices along the $x$- and $y$-axis ([image source](https://chaochen.github.io/publications/chen_topoinvis_2011.pdf)):

The dimension of a cell $(x,y,z,w)$ is given by the number of even values (odd if starting from 0) in its coordinate. For instance, $(2,2)$ above would be the square (dimension 2) in the bottom-left corner. The boundary map follows a simple pattern. Consider a square $(x,y)$ in the above array; then the boundary is given by
$$
	\partial(x,y) = (x+1,y) + (x,y+1) - (x-1,y) - (x,y-1).
$$

Consider the faces (dimension 3) given by 
$$
	F_1=\{(x,y,z,1):x,y,z\in\{2,4,6,8,10\}\}~\text{ and }~F_2=\{(x,y,z,11):x,y,z\in\{2,4,6,8,10\}\}
$$
which gives the 2-cycles
$$
\begin{align*}
	\pi_1&=\partial F_1 = \sum_{x,y,z\in\{2,4,6,8,10\}}\sum_{i=1}^3\big[(x+\delta_1(i),y+\delta_2(i),z+\delta_3(i),1)-(x-\delta_1(i),y-\delta_2(i),z-\delta_3(i),1)\big] \\
	\pi_2&=\partial F_2 = \sum_{x,y,z\in\{2,4,6,8\}}\sum_{i=1}^3\big[(x+\delta_1(i),y+\delta_2(i),z+\delta_3(i),11)-(x-\delta_1(i),y-\delta_2(i),z-\delta_3(i),11)\big].
\end{align*}
$$
Define the input 2-cycle $\pi=\pi_1-\pi_2$. Right now, this should be homologous to the zero-cycle. However, if cut a hole through our 4D cube (by removing the cells $\{(6,6,6,w):1\le w\le11\}$) then the optimal cycle should be $\pi'=\pi'_2-\pi'_1$ where
$$
\begin{align*}
	\pi'_1 &= \sum_{i=1}^3\big[(6+\delta_1(i),6+\delta_2(i),6+\delta_3(i),1)-(6-\delta_1(i),6-\delta_2(i),6-\delta_3(i),1)\big] \\
	&= (7,6,6,1)+(6,7,6,1) + (6,6,7,1) - (5,6,6,1) - (6,5,6,1) - (6,6,5,1)\\
	\pi'_2 &= \sum_{i=1}^3\big[(6+\delta_1(i),6+\delta_2(i),6+\delta_3(i),1)-(6-\delta_1(i),6-\delta_2(i),6-\delta_3(i),11)\big] \\
	&= (7,6,6,11)+(6,7,6,11) + (6,6,7,11) - (5,6,6,11) - (6,5,6,11) - (6,6,5,11).
\end{align*}
$$

**Remark:** It would probably be simpler to just take $\pi_1$ as the input cycle.
