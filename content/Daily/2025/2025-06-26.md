# Meeting Summary: Amber, Bala, & Bei

We are interested in either extending or generalizing current work on contour boxplots. Current approaches make use of a notion of *depth* of a data point. For instance in $\R$, consider the points $v_1<v_2<\dots<v_5$. The data point $v_4$ would have $\textup{depth}(v_4)=3$ as it is contained in 3 intervals ($(v_1,v_5)$, $(v_2,v_5)$, and $(v_3,v_5)$) where as $\textup{depth}(v_3)=4$ as it is contained in 4 intervals. One may view $\textup{depth}(\cdot)$ as a measure of centrality. Hence, we can view the median entry as the entry of maximal depth.

We would like to use this notion of depth in the case of a data set consisting of curves. However, identifying containment of a curve between two other curves is less clear as we see in the example below:

The red curve above doesn't lie between the two curves, but most of the curve does. Perhaps we could modify the definition of depth to include some error parameter $\epsilon$ where we consider a curve $\gamma$ being *nested* between two other curves $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ if it lies between them for all but some area $\mu\le\epsilon$. This leads to the following question:

**Main Question:** Can we apply flat norm curve simplification to contour boxplots?

Doing any sort of flat norm operation on the curves leaves us with two potential versions:
1. Simplify curves $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ to form $\hat{\gamma_1}$ and $\hat{\gamma_2}$ and use the new curves to check if $\gamma$ is nested between $\hat{\gamma_1}$ and $\hat{\gamma_2}$.
2. Transform input $\gamma\mapsto\hat{\gamma}$ such that $\hat{\gamma}$ is nested between $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$.

We can also view the second version as finding the minimal amount of perturbation $\epsilon$ to "untangle" the input curve. This also would allow us to change from a single true/false binary in our $\textup{nested}$ check to a continuous weight. Where a smaller $\epsilon$ is given a higher weight (perhaps something like $1/\epsilon$). From here we could define the depth of a curve $\gamma\in\Sigma$ by the sum
$$
	\sum_{(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)\in\Sigma\times\Sigma} \textup{nested}(\gamma,\gamma_1,\gamma_2).
